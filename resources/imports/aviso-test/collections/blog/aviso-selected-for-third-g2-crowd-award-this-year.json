This is why we are thrilled to announce that we have been selected for our third G2 award this year.\n\nEarlier this year, we were recognized as a “Top 50 Sales Tools 2019” and a “G2 Sales Analytics Leader for Winter 2019.” Most recently, we have been selected a Fall 2019 Leader in both overall “Sales Analytics Tools” and also “Mid-Market Sales Analytics Tools.”\n\nThis announcement has come at a pivotal time in our journey as a startup. We’re rapidly expanding our platform capabilities, employee headcount, and customer base. This includes new capabilities we’ve developed in partnership with our customers, such as deal and forecast rooms, a team-wide system of nudges, and enhancements in our core prediction platform.\n\nCustomer review websites such <a href=\"https://www.g2.com/\">G2</a> provide value for both the buyer and the seller. We find honest feedback about our platform priceless to building a better user experience; prospective buyers get third-party validation that a software service is right for their needs. Thank you to our passionate customers for providing us insight into how they use Aviso everyday as well as G2 for enabling this process and selecting us again.\n\n<strong>Read our reviews on G2 <a href=\"https://www.g2.com/products/aviso/reviews\">here</a> or catch some highlights below: </strong>\n\n“Aviso's ability to understand the trends and forecasting accuracy of each rep is simply amazing.
