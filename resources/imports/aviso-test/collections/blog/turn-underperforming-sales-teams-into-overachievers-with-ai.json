That’s why it’s so difficult for sales managers to recruit and retain highly productive, professional salespeople. Improving sales performance and stemming the tide of defectors is a hot topic, although managers have few answers or plans to address.\n\nThe 80 – 20 rule is often cited. According to Inc. Magazine, most sales teams have a few high achievers, and a larger group are lackluster performers. Only a fifth of salespeople usually exceed quota on the average team, which means that 80 % often miss their quota. Why?\n\n·       Only 20% of companies have an accuracy of 80% or better with sales forecasting\n\n·       Nearly 59% of sales forecasts are wrong\n\n·       90% of spreadsheets contain errors that can compromise forecasts\n\n·       Only 4 out of 10 deals forecasted will actually close\n<h4>Compare Those Stats to Sales Teams That Use AI</h4>\n·       10.5x more likely to experience a positive impact on forecast accuracy\n\n·       70% believe in AI to transform Intelligent Forecasting\n\n·       66% trust AI to substantially impact Opportunity Insights\n\n·       65% have high confidence in AI to uncover Account Insights\n<h4>And, Those That Use Aviso AI</h4>\nAviso AI-powered Opportunity Management WinScores, Insights, Maps, and Forecasting help teams focus on which deals have the highest probability to close.
