{"title":"Sales KPIs Only Data Science Can Reveal","image":"","content":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most sales organizations have a unique set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that they track religiously. Other than basic revenue numbers which have been tracked since the early days of trade and commerce (ok, basically since the beginning of human civilization), it was business intelligence (BI) that really gave life to a more complex set of data analysis capable of being stored, tracked, sorted, searched, and modeled. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data science takes “basic intelligence” to the next level. Using data science, massive amounts of information can be processed instantly to provide insights that are simply impossible using rudimentary equations. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We believe data science can help sales teams create and maintain the most accurate and up-to-date sales forecasts possible. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aviso’s data science technology can do three things better than old-school BI technologies:</span>\n<ol>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Forecasting: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BI can try to predict your forecast, but only with data science can you produce accurate predictive answers. Aviso uses Data Science to arrive at a data-driven end of quarter number that averages within 4% of your company’s actual EOQ bookings. Even better, Aviso breaks this EOQ prediction down week by week - giving you early warning signs if your quarter is off track, and the necessary time to adjust your sales strategy to ensure a successful quarter.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Focusing: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BI is excellent at averaging bulk numbers and giving a general percentage of what will close in a quarter, but not good at pinpointing which individual deals will actually come in and which ones will fall out--introducing an intolerable amount of risk. Aviso scores each deal--between 0 and 100--and gives you the exact likelihood of a specific opportunity closing within the current quarter and looks at how the deal should be progressing compared to similar and historical opportunities. Handy, right?</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Prioritizing: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is an area where BI definitely falls short. For BI technologies, figuring out which deals that reps and managers should focus on is a complete guessing game. Aviso’s special sauce lets you know exactly which deals to focus on and suggests activities, strategies, and communications that will help bring the most critical deals across the finish line.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We talk a big game, but don’t take our word for it. Listen to Bill Dolby, Global Sales Operations Leader at RingCentral, talk about it in this </span><a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/customers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">video</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where he says, “Spreadsheets and BI tools lack the predictive capabilities to guide our sales forecast at each level of the sales hierarchy.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bill, we hear you.
