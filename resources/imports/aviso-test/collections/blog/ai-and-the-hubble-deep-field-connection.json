{"title":"AI and the Hubble Deep Field Connection","image":"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/huble3-300x169.jpg","content":"Customer facing selling time is precious every quarter. Sales teams have to quickly determine which deals will close and can’t afford to spend a lot of time on ‘what if’ scenarios. Time is equally valuable on the Hubble Space Telescope. Every operational second is reserved months to years in advance. So, imagine the response when an astronomer proposed pointing Hubble at a seemingly empty patch of sky for 100 hours. His colleagues thought it a wasteful idea. \"We have so many things to do! There's no time! I've been doing this for 25 years! There's nothing to learn by trying that!\" were some of the objections.\n\nNevertheless, the team knew that they had never had such a powerful technology at their disposal. So they took a chance. The result? The discovery of 3,000 new galaxies in a tiny patch of sky.  The resulting image, known as Hubble Deep Field, has been called “the most important image ever taken” and has spawned new fields of research and transformed our understanding of the universe.\n\nFrom a data science perspective, the data from those galaxies has always existed in that “dark patch of sky”. Before Hubble, we simply never had the tools or technologies to even consider how staring at what appears to be empty space could literally shed light on something we simply couldn't see before.  Hubble's technology literally enabled us to see things we could never see with conventional tools.\n\nIn a similar manner, applying AI to CRM data and your sales processes provides sales teams and executive leadership insights into their performance they could never deduce with traditional transactional sales tools or methods. Aviso's customers analyze, interpret and score more opportunities faster than any other method.
