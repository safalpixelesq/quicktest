This includes a new login screen, improving visibility, a more prominent and legible font set, and streamlined navigation. An example of color change is the use of the Sunset-Red colored Aviso logomark to key AI columns along with a deep blue-toned purple (that we call Evening-Blue) font color to any data that is powered by our AI core.<img class=\" wp-image-9135 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Frame-624-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"530\" height=\"530\" /><strong>[2] Upgrades to the individual and team Forecast Update experience</strong> with better placement of contextual actions to update forecasts at every level of a team’s hierarchy, as well roll up forecast capabilities for managers and VPs of Sales. <img class=\"wp-image-9136 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Frame-625-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"621\" height=\"621\" /><strong style=\"font-size: 1em;\">[3] An upgrade to our Deal Views and Deal Guidance capabilities</strong><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\"> with updated visual Deal Cards, new toggles for At-Risk deals, more intuitive visualization of deals in forecast versus out of forecast, updated filter and comments icons, updated favorite icon, and a consistent Win Score style with the web. </span>\n\n<img class=\"wp-image-9138 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Frame-623.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"636\" height=\"636\" /><strong>[4] Upgrades to the Aviso Opportunity/Deal Map.</strong> Following a similar pattern to the web styling, we have two sections: one for “In Forecast” and the other for “Not in Forecast”. Each quadrant has been re-styled as individual rows and follow similar card-styling as the web with the circle and data on right and labels on left.\n\n<img class=\"wp-image-9139 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Frame-615.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"620\" />\n\n<strong>[5] Upgrades to the Pacing Curve</strong> to help sales reps and managers know where they stand on a given day versus where AI recommends they should be.
