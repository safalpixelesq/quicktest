Imagine yourself as a doctor trying to diagnose a patient. Rather than prescribing medication right off the bat, you should seek to uncover their problems and needs.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a discovery call, you'll have the opportunity to ask questions and learn more about your buyer: who they are, what role they play in their organization, what pain points or needs they have, and what their goals are.</span>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11035\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Group-1247-2-683x600.jpg\" alt=\"Sample target audiences for larger enterprises: EMEA and Americas.

Don’t worry. With a little bit of preparation, discovery calls can be simple and straightforward.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below, I’ve listed an essential roadmap with the 3 steps to follow in order to streamline your discovery calls, including a pre-call checklist and examples of discovery call questions. Let’s get started!</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #bf416d;\"><strong>The 3 Steps to Execute a Rock-solid Discovery Call</strong></span></h2>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #993366;\">Step 1. Research your prospect.</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Preparing for your discovery call is half the battle. Each prospect is unique, and it’s important to tailor your approach to each client in order to best optimize your upcoming conversation.</span>\n\n<b>Start by setting out 10-15 minutes to scope out your lead. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, you’ll want to identify a “hook” -- a point of common interest or connection that hits the three Rs: </span><span style=\"color: #bf416d;\"><a style=\"color: #bf416d;\" href=\"https://www.sellingfromtheheart.net/blog/sales-professionals-are-real-relatable-relevant-with-their-clients-are-you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Real, Relatable, and Relevant</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></a></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you share a love for travel or a mutual friend, your aim should be to establish an authentic connection built on trust. More than anything, your prospect wants to know they can rely on you to deliver on your promises.</span>\n\n<b>Tap into the wealth of information available on the Internet</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. A quick search on Google, LinkedIn or Twitter can provide a lot of insight into your prospect’s personal values and interests.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Likewise, make sure to skim through their company’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About Us</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> page, PR, blog articles, and associated social media to get a sense of the company’s organizational structure and overarching goals.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a look into your CRM and </span><span style=\"color: #bf416d;\"><a style=\"color: #bf416d;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/crm-automation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">customer reporting tools</span></a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to see what information is already available. Review any previous interactions you might have had with your lead, such as emails or recorded conversations.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep your eyes peeled for red flags that might disqualify your prospect. Recognizing that your lead is not a good fit is equally important and can save you valuable time and effort.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are several pre-call questions to answer as you conduct your research:</span>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11034\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pre-Call-Checklist-1.jpg\" alt=\"Sample discovery call prep checklist. Jennifer Wang.\" width=\"604\" height=\"556\" />\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #993366;\">Step 2. Plan out your discovery strategy.</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use what you learned in your 10-minute research session to help you to create an effective outline for your conversation.</span>\n\n<b>The next step is to structure a discovery call agenda. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go into the discovery call with a clear vision of what you’re hoping to accomplish within the timeframe of the call and lay out a path with talking points and questions that will help you achieve this goal.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can tailor this structure to fit your needs and your client. Using a discovery call agenda, you can develop a script for each section and customize it to fit your own style.</span>\n\n<img class=\"alignright wp-image-11036\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Group-1248-1.jpg\" alt=\"Five-point discovery call model. Image courtesy of Aviso design team.\" width=\"291\" height=\"277\" />\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A typical discovery call will follow this basic structure:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Introductions</span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expectations</span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discovery</span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solution</span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next steps</span></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s walk through each of these sections individually.</span>\n\n<b>Start with introductions</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The first few minutes of your discovery call are crucial. In this section, your goal is to build rapport and set the tone.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Introduce yourself, your company, your role, and your solution’s </span><span style=\"color: #bf416d;\"><a style=\"color: #bf416d;\" href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">value proposition</span></a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 20-30 seconds. Here’s where you can also use your “hook” to establish your connection with the prospect and to reassure them that you are trustworthy, reliable, and worth their time.</span>\n\n<b>Set expectations</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Manage expectations by explaining to the prospect how you intend for the discovery call to unfold. You want for the prospect to understand that this initial meeting is for you to learn about the prospect and their needs.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some best practices include:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sharing your objectives for the meeting</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outlining several main points</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Touching on future actions (e.g., “I’ll follow up with an email after our discussion today.”)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<b>Dive into discovery. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s time to dive into the heart of the matter: learning about your prospect’s needs and goals. Prepare a general list of questions that focus on qualifying/disqualifying the buyer. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t know where to begin? Here’s a sample checklist of discovery call questions:</span>\n<ol>\n \t<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tell me about your company. </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are some of the main responsibilities of your role?</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What projects are you currently working on? What is your goal for these projects?</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How does it impact you or your company if you are unable to reach this goal?</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you have an assigned budget for this project? </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you made similar purchases in the past?</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are some challenges you’re facing?</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How are you handling these challenges?</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do you see our solution fitting in your process?</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What options are you considering?</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ll want to pay close attention to your prospect's tone of voice and what they say, and consider what this might mean for the deal. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, if your prospect tells you that a higher-up is responsible for the budget, </span><span style=\"color: #bf416d;\"><a style=\"color: #bf416d;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/5-surprising-reasons-why-your-deals-arent-closing-and-what-to-do-instead/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you might be speaking to the wrong person</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></span>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11037\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Talk-Duration-1.jpg\" alt=\"Discovery call talk duration. Image courtesy of Aviso product and design team.\" width=\"363\" height=\"200\" />\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember also that a discovery call should be a two-way dialogue. As a rule of thumb, <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/conversational-intelligence/\"><span style=\"color: #c7344a;\">a good talk-to-listen ratio is 50:50</span></a>. Don’t just </span>grill your prospect <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with a never-ending list of questions!</span>\n\n<b>Share your solution</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. After you’ve qualified your lead and are satisfied with the information you’ve acquired, you can move on to discussing your solution.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many discovery calls will include a soft sell-- a low-pressure explanation of your product or service, often accompanied by FAQs, objections, and customer case studies. </span><span style=\"color: #bf416d;\"><a style=\"color: #bf416d;\" href=\"https://larrygmaguire.com/hard-selling/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s why a hard sell doesn’t work.</span></a></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most importantly, you should touch on the needs and pain points of your prospect. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why should they care about your product or service? </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Align your solution with a challenge they mentioned earlier in the conversation. Address any potential objections and share success stories from clients similar to your prospect.</span>\n\n<b>Proceed with next-steps. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wrap up your discovery call with a shared understanding of what will happen next.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leave off future actions for a second interaction. Depending on the information you’ve gained, you might want to schedule a second call to conduct a demo or discuss personalized pricing. If you find that your prospect is not a good fit for your business, you could let them know that you’ll reach out with a follow-up email later.</span>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11038\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Modal-Next-Steps-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"Notification example for discovery call next steps.

Keep an open mind.</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Congrats! You’ve done your research, filled out your agenda, and now you’re geared up to nail the discovery call. Finally, it’s time to meet your prospect.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key to success here is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flexibility</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Go with the flow -- it’s okay to break script and ask questions you feel are relevant to the discovery call.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some tips for an effective conversation:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Ask open-ended questions</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Leave room for your prospect to expand on their answers. If they’re giving one-word replies, prompt them with a statement such as “Tell me about ___.”</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Listen and empathize</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. People like to be heard. Pay attention to what your prospect says, validate their emotions, and offer up your own thoughts in response. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Ask for feedback</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It’s good practice to ask your prospect how they feel about the conversation and if they have any questions. Here's your chance to clear up any lingering confusion or misunderstandings.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Keep an open mind</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Sometimes, after all of your preparation, things don’t go as planned -- and that’s alright! You’ll leave the conversation having learned from the experience.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Leave a positive impression</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As you conclude your discovery call, remind your prospect of the benefits of your solution. Let the prospect know that you enjoyed the conversation and that you’re eager to work with them again.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11039\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Conversational-Intelligence_Sentiment-1181x600.jpg\" alt=\"Sentiment analysis for each speaker of the discovery call.
