In this clip, Ken discussed how Aviso met the needs of Silver Peak’s specific business requirements when being on-boarded and throughout the whole process. This was very important at Silver Peak due to their unique revenue stream model, which is very different from your standard software company.\n\n<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/421973221\"><img class=\" wp-image-8803 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kl-video-2-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"639\" height=\"359\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>How does Aviso help CROs like you attain predictable business outcomes?</strong>\n\nKen wasn’t initially a true believer that AI technology would be able to accurately forecast revenue. But over time, he realized that Aviso's predictive forecasting was consistently within 3-4% of where they ended up at EOQ. Hear from Ken on how predictive forecasting enabled ultimate visibility into his channel-partner revenue model at Silver Peak.\n\n<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/421972939\"><img class=\" wp-image-8805 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kl-video-3-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"638\" height=\"357\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Can you share your sales journey from inside sales rep to successful CRO?</strong>\n\nIn this video, Ken talks about how he worked way up from being an SDR at Siebel to CRO at Silver Peak.

Ken's advice is to the point: if you're a sales rep just starting off, it's imperative to know that nobody’s going to give you a list of leads that are going to turn into pure gold revenue. You need to get out there and hustle, work hard, network, and build your personal brand.\n\n<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/421972346\"><img class=\"wp-image-8807 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kl-video-5-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"638\" height=\"358\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>At Silver Peak, how did you manage your day with Aviso and other tools?</strong>\n\nAs CRO, Ken started every morning looking at sales forecasts on Aviso AI.
