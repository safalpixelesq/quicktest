Let's start off by defining RevOps.\n<h2>What is RevOps?</h2>\n<strong>Revenue operations</strong> (<strong>RevOps</strong>) is a business function that optimizes revenue growth by aligning sales, marketing, and customer success operations. RevOps serves to drive accountability across these different departments for a unified approach to revenue generation.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11148 \" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RevOps.png\" alt=\"Revenue operations (RevOps) infographic aligning marketing, sales, and customer success.\" width=\"433\" height=\"142\" />\n\nYou may be familiar with the traditional departments in a B2B organization -- Marketing Ops, Sales Ops, Customer Success Ops. Each department has its own operations team dedicated to streamlining the productivity of its members. The goals of each team are set by the head of each department.\n\nAs a result, each department often develops separate motivations and responsibilities and may use separate technologies or methods to reach their goals.\n\nAs you can imagine, this can easily lead to the forming of <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #993366;\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/silo-mentality.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">organ</a></span><span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #993366;\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/silo-mentality.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">izational</a></span><span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #993366;\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/silo-mentality.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> silos</a></span> -- a gateway for poor communication and a lack of cohesion, which in turn can create <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #993366;\" href=\"https://www.talend.com/resources/what-are-data-silos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">data silos</a></span> that stifle workflow, derail business processes, and damage customer experiences.\n\nTo prevent this, businesses have turned to a centralized revenue function that understands the workings of and bridges the gap between separate departments -- a function we now call Revenue Operations.\n<h2>Benefits of RevOps</h2>\nHubspot reports that public companies with revenue operations support saw <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #993366;\" href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/revenue-operations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">71% higher stock performance, grew 19% faster, and raised 15% more profit than companies without.</a></span>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11149 \" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/55.png\" alt=\"From 2018 to 2019, there was a 55% increase in adoption of revenue operations (revops).\" width=\"493\" height=\"259\" />\n\nWhen successfully implemented, a strong RevOps team can offer many benefits, including:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Addressing <a href=\"https://info.aviso.com/state-of-virtual-selling-2020\"><span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>tool sprawl</strong></span></a> for better productivity and communication between teams</li>\n \t<li>Sharing <strong><span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #993366;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/revenueteamroles/\">cross-departmental insights</a></span></strong> for better customer journey and client retention and expansion</li>\n \t<li>Facilitating <strong><span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #993366;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/accelerate-remote-selling-with-guided-collaboration/\">transparency</a> </span></strong>for faster strategic growth</li>\n</ul>\nRevOps can provide your company with a significant competitive advantage. However, it’s up to you to find the right revenue leader and qualified operations specialists to truly tap into the optimal alignment for your business.\n<h2>How to Get Started with RevOps</h2>\nSuccessful RevOps teams will carve out higher-efficiency, cost-saving workflows for all the departments they work with. To do so, teams need to invest in these three key steps:\n<h4><strong>1. ASSESS</strong></h4>\nConduct an audit to identify processes that need improvement. Where do the sources of misalignment occur? How can information be better shared internally? For example, if sales and customer success teams are using different tools to communicate with clients, vital information is likely slipping through the cracks. It will be essential for your team to identify these problem areas in order to find solutions.\n\n<em>Pro tip:</em> calculate expenditures on total resource use. This can reveal areas where your team can both cut costs and align more effectively.\n<h4><strong>2. ALIGN</strong></h4>\nAlign your organization with <a href=\"https://info.aviso.com/a-week-in-the-life-of-sales?__hstc=27879020.e7f239f0f0fe5d0331ebc6e2472eac3e.1592153922866.1605668829087.1605671119204.52&amp;__hssc=27879020.2.1605671119204&amp;__hsfp=264725493\"><span style=\"color: #993366;\">unified tech stacks</span></a>, training practices, and <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #993366;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/the-top-3-ways-ai-guided-forecasting-beats-spreadsheets/\">data systems</a></span> that match the needs of its users. Consider using AI-based tools to automate tasks like CRM data entry that team members typically find time-sucks.\n<h4><strong>3. ASSIGN</strong></h4>\nIdentify the key players needed and communicate your plan for growth. Set clear expectations for overarching missions, long-term goals, and immediate next-steps. Choose team leaders to hold others accountable. Ideally, each go-to-market team will have a RevOps project leader.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11150 \" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/steps.png\" alt=\"3 steps to successful revops infographic: assess, align, and assign.\" width=\"548\" height=\"214\" />\n\nThe RevOps framework above allows for you to hone in on how to establish better cohesion, unity, and efficiency within your business.
