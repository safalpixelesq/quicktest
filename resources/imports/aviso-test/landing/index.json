		"content": "The phrase “you can manage something only when you measure it” stands true, especially for critical business functions like sales. However, there is also the question of are you measuring the right sales effectiveness metrics? — Key sales performance indicators like Lead-to-win rate, consistent Quota attainment, etc., can help revenue leaders gauge team performance and sales strategy effectiveness, and It is critical to accurately and periodically track them. \n\nThis article gives you a list of saas sales metrics that revenue leaders should be tracking for go-to-market success. \n<h2><b>What Are Sales Metrics? </b></h2>\nSales metrics/analytics indicate how an organization, team, or individual rep is performing. Sales leaders and CEOs use these data points to measure and improve team performance, productivity, and sales effectiveness, enabling them to drive accurate sales forecasts, identify gaps in their selling process, and course-correct wherever needed. \n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><b>Also Read: </b><a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/sales-forecasting/\"><b>Sales Forecasting Tips &amp; Techniques</b></a></p>\n\n<h2><b>15 Important Sales Metrics To Track:</b></h2>\nTo set an ideal strategic direction for your team and provide the most effective answers to your CRO's questions, here are some of the metrics you need to track:\n\n<ol>\n \t\n<h4><b><li>Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)/Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)</li></b></h4>\n\n\nMRR is an excellent measure of whether your teams are winning deals and hitting quarterly targets. At the same time, ARR gauges the market readiness of your GTM strategy and your team's capability to execute and grow long-term. ARR is also a great indicator of predictable revenue flow\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11512\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Formula1-600x141.jpg\" alt=\"ARR/MRR Sales Metrics Formula\" width=\"600\" height=\"141\" />\n\n \t\n<h4><b><li>Average Revenue Per Account or Average Revenue Per Customer</li></b></h4>\n\n\nThe Average Revenue Per User or Account (ARPU or ARPA) is the amount of money that a company brings in per subscriber, user, or account in a particular period. ARPA/ARPU helps sales leaders understand their attainment status and what they should be focusing on going forward. \n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11513\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Formula2-600x141.jpg\" alt=\"ARPA Sales Metrics Formula\" width=\"600\" height=\"141\" />\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><b>Also Read: </b><a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/revenue-forecasting/\"><b>Best Revenue Forecasting Techniques</b></a></p>\n\n\n \t\n<h4><b><li>Quota Attainment or Sales Per Rep</li></b></h4>\n\n\nQuota attainment is the percentage of deals a sales rep has won in relation to their set quota for a given period. Quota attainment is significant because any indication of a decline in hitting the target quota points to gaps in areas like coaching and capacity planning within the organization.\n\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11514\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Formula3-600x141.jpg\" alt=\"Sales Per Rep matrics\" width=\"600\" height=\"141\" />\n\n \t\n<h4><b><li>Pipeline Coverage</li></b></h4>\n\n\nPipeline coverage refers to the total amount of deals in your sales pipeline to ensure you reach your sales target. As a standard, an organizations’ pipeline is 3x their revenue target so that factors like deal slippage and lost deals don’t prevent them from hitting targets. For example: If your sales target for the quarter is $1 million, an indication of adequate coverage would be having $3 million in the pipe.\n\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11515\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Formula4-600x141.jpg\" alt=\"Sales Pipeline Metrics\" width=\"600\" height=\"141\" />\n\n \t\n<h4><b><li>Year-over-Year Growth</li></b></h4>\n\n\nYOY growth measures your organizations’ revenue for the current against the revenue you made last year. Although you can measure Y-O-Y growth over any time frame, such as monthly, quarterly, or yearly, annual growth indicates consistent execution across your salesforce.<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11516\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Formula5-600x141.jpg\" alt=\"sales growth metric\" width=\"600\" height=\"141\" />\n\n \t\n<h4><b><li>Win Rate</li></b></h4>\n\n\nWin rate, also known as the opportunity-to-win ratio, refers to the percentage of deals that your sales team closes compared to the total deals present in the pipeline. Win rate is a  direct indicator of sales effectiveness and the ability of your team to close deals.<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11517\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Formula6-600x141.jpg\" alt=\"Sales Win Score metric\" width=\"600\" height=\"141\" />\n\n \t\n<h4><b><li>Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)</li></b></h4>\n\n\nLifetime customer value, also called LTV/CLTV, shows the cumulative revenue you will generate from a customer as long as they remain a paying customer.\n\nLTV can highlight deficiencies in your product or customer service. For example, an ACV of $100k multiplied over six months will result in a loss of $50k in potential revenue. This loss in revenue indicates a high churn rate and signals you to focus on retaining customers to realize recurring revenue for the long term.<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11518\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Formula7-600x141.jpg\" alt=\"Sales Customer Metrics\" width=\"600\" height=\"141\" />\n\n \t\n<h4><b><li>Average Selling Price</li></b></h4>\n\n\nAverage selling price refers to the average amount that a customer pays when they sign up to use your company’s products/services. This metric indicates your sales teams’ ability to go up-market and win large deals. Here is the calculation for ASP:\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11519\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Formula8-600x141.jpg\" alt=\"Selling Price Matric\" width=\"600\" height=\"141\" />\n\n \t\n<h4><b><li>Opportunity age/ Average Sales Cycle time</li></b></h4>\n\n\nAverage sales cycle length refers to the time your sales team takes to convert a prospect into a paying customer, across your sales team/organization. Here’s how you calculate this metric:\n\nThe length of the sales cycle varies from business to business. There are several factors like pricing, target industry, size of the deal, and so on, that influence the time taken to close. However, some universally accepted best practices that help build prospect trust and shorten sales cycles are:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Featuring credible testimonials on your website</li>\n \t<li>Sharing case studies of customers with similar company size who your product/service has influenced etc</li>\n</ul>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11520\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Formula9-600x141.jpg\" alt=\"Sales Cycle time metric\" width=\"600\" height=\"141\" />\n\n \t\n<h4><b><li>Conversion Rate: Qualified lead to Closed-won</li></b></h4>\n\n\nThis sales metric is used to evaluate the effectiveness of your sales team’s to convert qualified opportunities into closed-won deals.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11521\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Formula10-600x141.jpg\" alt=\"Conversion Rate Sales Metric\" width=\"600\" height=\"141\" />\n\n\n \t\n<h4><b><li>Net Promoter Score (NPS)</li></b></h4>\n\n\nNPS surveys might seem like a job for the customer success or product success teams to run, but the survey results can also influence your sales pipeline. If your existing customers are satisfied with your service, they are more likely to speak to their network about it. Thereby leading to organic pipeline growth and consequently increase in revenue.\n\nThe question “How likely are you to recommend our product to your friend or colleague?” forms the basis of the NPS survey, with answers numbered from 1 to 10. The survey also acts as a measure for customer satisfaction since your customers would only promote a service or product that they find useful.<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11522\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Formula11-600x141.jpg\" alt=\"NPS Sales Metric\" width=\"600\" height=\"141\" />\n\n \t\n<h4><b><li>Linearity</li></b></h4>\n\n\nSales linearity is when reps close their deals on a consistent week-to-week and month-to-month basis throughout the quarter, as planned. This is a much healthier alternative than closing deals in bulk at the end of the quarter to fulfill the quota.\n\nFor example: If the sales target for the particular quarter is $1 Million, reps should aim to attain $200k of their quota by the end of the first month, $500k for the second month, and $300K in the third month, thereby fulfilling the $1 Million quotas.\n\nThese consistent wins make reps more accountable, drive predictable revenue, allowing more strategic investments. This also helps post-sales teams like customer success to plan ahead and manage newly-onboarded customers.\n\nA close study of this data will show your company whether it needs to invest more time, training, and resources in creating a better sales strategy for the entire quarter.\n\n \t\n<h4><b><li>Sales Expense Ratio</li></b></h4>\n\n\nThe higher your sales expense ratio, the less profitable your sales organization will be. It is critical to compare your cost of sales, customer acquisition costs, and indirect operating expenses to the revenue your sales reps are generating.\n\nExpense ratios differ across organizations, and business unit sizes play a role as well. For example, startups will have higher expense ratios, since they’d want to onboard as many customers as possible to increase adoption. But as your market matures, your sales expense ratio should decrease.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11523\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Formula12-600x141.jpg\" alt=\"Sales Expense Ratio Metric\" width=\"600\" height=\"141\" />\n\n \t\n<h4><b><li>Deal Slippage</li></b></h4>\n\n\nDeals that don't close within the expected time in the forecast with their target dates getting pushed out to a later date (typically from one quarter to another) constitute slipped deals. For example, A deal in the commit for Q1, getting pushed to Q2 due to budget constraints, or other such circumstances.\n\nTracking deal slippages in a spreadsheet or a CRM field may prove to be unintuitive today. Platforms like Aviso can pinpoint how, when, and where a pipeline changed so teams can prevent and remedy deal slippage.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><b>Also Read: </b><a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/crm-automation-benefits/\"><b>Benefits Of Sales CRM Automation</b></a></p>\n\n\n \t\n<h4><b><li>Sales Activity Metrics</li></b></h4>\n\n\nSales activity metrics represent the activity of your sales representatives on a day-to-day basis. It’s important for sales leaders to grasp how these daily actions can impact overall selling and optimize them as needed. \n\nActivity metrics can reveal strengths and weaknesses that may influence a sales representative’s performance. By analyzing the outcomes of these activities on top performers, you can share results with the broader team and get them to adopt best practices.\n</ol>\n<b>Activity sales metrics sales leaders should track:</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Calls</li>\n \t<li>Contacts touched</li>\n \t<li>Contacts touched per Account</li>\n \t<li>Days between each Opportunity touched</li>\n \t<li>Emails Sent</li>\n \t<li>Meetings Created</li>\n \t<li>Meetings on Calendar</li>\n \t<li>New Accounts Touched</li>\n \t<li>New Contacts Touched</li>\n \t<li>New Opportunities Owned</li>\n \t<li>Prospecting -  Calls, Emails sent, Meeting on Calendar</li>\n \t<li>Untouched - Accounts, Opportunities</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><b>Also Read: </b><a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/handling-sales-objection/\"><b>How To Handle Sales Objections</b></a></p>\n<b style=\"color: #333333; font-size: 26px;\">Challenges In Tracking Sales Metrics</b>\n\nIt is pertinent for sales leadership to regularly be on top of their team/hierarchy’s sales metrics. Reviewing these metrics as an afterthought will result in a gut-based decision-making process instead of one that is fact-based. There has to be a well-structured approach to monitor these metrics and obtain a holistic view across the entire sales organization to break out of silos and act on the insights provided by the data.\n\nCreating and updating sales metrics dashboards on a daily basis would take X+ hours of a dedicated analyst's time every week. As a best practice, automating the generation of these reports helps balance real-time data with person-hours spent on menial work - A Revenue Intelligence software is a quick way to do this. \n\n<b style=\"color: #333333; font-size: 26px;\">Accurate And Real-Time Sales Metric Data With Aviso’s RevOps Platform:</b>\n\nWorld-class revenue teams like Honeywell, Ringcentral, and Ivanti use Aviso to forecast revenue and close <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/deal-intelligence/\">deals</a> effectively with real-time sales data.

		"title": "25 Common Sales Objections And How To Handle Them?",
		"image": "https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blog-Sales-objections-handling.jpeg",
		"content": "The word 'no' or uncertainties can demotivate and scare off sales reps. It is easier to dismiss these objections and move on to other clients than address them. Dodging sales objections is an impossible task as it is a natural part of the sales process. However, when we dive into it, sales objections can benefit your sales team. It is essential that sales reps can identify and respond to sales objections rather than quit. In this blog, you will learn about what a sales objection is, sales objection examples, sales objection handling examples, and why it is important to have a plan.\n<h2><b>What Is A Sales Objection?</b></h2>\nA sales objection is an indication that a specific reason is preventing a buyer from purchasing a product or service from you.\nSales objections are rarely communicated to tell sales reps “no”. Some sales reps make the mistake of interpreting a sales objection as a nicer form of rejection. However, a sales expert will perceive any sales objection as a positive. It means the prospective client is open-minded and is interested in hearing more rather than conceding the relationship. Sales reps can take the opportunity to learn more about their prospect and find specific methods to address their reservations.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><b>Also Read: </b><a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/top-10-sales-books-you-need-to-read-2021-guide/\"><b>Best Sales Books Of All Time</b></a></p>\n\n<h2><b>Most Common Sales Objections:</b></h2>\nSeasoned sales reps often hear the same sales objections frequently, and have certain responses to those they hear most often. Here are some of the most common sales objections and answers to them:\n<ol>\n \t<li><b>“I do not see how this product/service benefits me.”</b></li>\nThis is the go-to phrase for prospective buyers when they are in need of more information.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nAsk the buyer what problems their organization is currently facing. Suggest that the specific problems they mention will be solved by your product/service.\n \t<li><b>“This is not our company’s priority right now.”</b></li>\nBuyers often use this sales objection when they need a vague but simple reason not to buy your product. Some buyers even use it as a cover-up because it is rare the buyer does not have time if they are communicating with sales reps.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nSell the prospect on time. Convince them that certain components of your product/service will save them time rather than waste it. Additionally, simplify your product so the prospect believes it will consume less of their time.\n \t<li><b>“I have never heard of your company.”</b></li>\nStart-up companies and various other small businesses are often faced with this type of sales objection. This is another common objection that is used when the customer has not yet established trust in the brand due to an inadequate amount of information.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nDo not take offense. Take the opportunity to provide the prospect with more information about your company. To take it a step even further, make suggestions to the prospect about what aspects of your business can improve on the prospect’s business problems.\n \t<li> <b>“This looks complicated.”</b></li>\nThis sales objection is one of the most difficult ones to address, especially if your product/service is in fact complicated. It should serve as a wake-up call to your business as complexity can strip customers of their time and funds as well as leave them frustrated.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nStart a root cause analysis. Determine if the prospect is confused about specific features or if the product is too advanced for them. If it is too advanced for them, you may have to disqualify them. If they are just confused about specific features, determine where improvements can be made and confirm with them your CSR team will assist them.\n \t<li><b>“I do not want to have to sign a contract.”</b></li>\nMost prospects who use this sales objection are already convinced about the product/service but are concerned about contract terms, cash flows, or the company budget.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nRe-open negotiations of the contract agreement. If your contract is an annual commitment, determine if you can offer a quarterly or monthly payment plan.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><b>Also Read: </b><a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/sales-quarterly-business-review/\"><b>How To Conduct Sales QBRs?</b></a></p>\n\n \t<li><b>“This is too expensive.”</b></li>\nPrice is the most common sales objection because it is the most crucial consideration of any purchase. This objection can be difficult to overcome because it is relative to that specific prospect.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nAvoid making the price a selling point. By attempting to defend price you minimize your effect on the buying process from a sales rep to a middleman. Instead, refocus the call on the product/service value and the ROI.\n \t<li><b>“We do not have the budget for this product/service right now.”</b></li>\nThis sales objection is similar but not identical to “This is too expensive.” Overcoming this sales objection is challenging due to the fact that organizations typically have a set budget before making a sales call.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nThis sales objection can be resolved in two ways. One option is to request to reach out to someone higher up in the prospect’s business that makes decisions on the budget. Attempt to convince this person to reorganize the budget. Another option is to arrange a follow-up meeting with the prospect when they expect an opening in their budget.\n \t<li><b>“We do not have the budget for this product/service right now due to COVID-19.”</b></li>\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses are more hesitant to make purchasing decisions. This situational objection is used when companies are implying they would be able to afford your product/service under normal circumstances.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nAsk the prospect what needs to occur for the company to return to regular business processes. Explain to the prospect how your business can expedite their business’s recovery process. Determine when is the right time for them and propose a follow-up call at that time.\n \t<li><b>“We need to use our budget for another product/service.”</b></li>\nCompanies will often designate resources and funds for other purposes when settling on a budget. By using this sales objection the buyer does not yet believe your product/service currently deserves budget allocation.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nMention similar cases in which previous/current clients ran into this issue. Explain how their decision to purchase improved the company’s finances, efficiency, or ROI.\n \t<li><b>“We do not have the business capacity for this product/service”</b></li>\nThis sales objection is used for one of two reasons. The prospect either believes they lack the necessary resources to effectively use your product/service or is uncomfortable with the integration process.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nIf the prospect’s company truly lacks resources you may have to disqualify them, but as a sales rep, you can study their day-to-day routine to better integrate your product/service. If they don’t understand, explain the process and the expected results.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><b>Also Read: </b><a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/revenue-forecasting/\"><b>Best Revenue Forecasting Techniques</b></a></p>\n\n \t<li><b>“Our company is transitioning to remote work and does not currently have the bandwidth for another product/service.”</b></li>\nSimilar to the budget objection due to COVID-19, this objection is circumstantial. The prospect is concerned about purchasing while making the gradual transition to a work-from-home environment.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nKeep communication with the prospect. Ask them what challenges they face and offer advice to handle their concerns. Furthermore, explain how your product/service will assist their transition rather than prolong it.\n \t<li><b>“I did not like [a similar product from a competitor].”</b></li>\nA prospect is less likely to purchase a product/service if they have been previously disappointed by a similar product/service. However, this type of sales objection does not necessarily mean they are less likely to purchase from your company.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nAsk the prospect what they did not like about their previous experience. Listen to what most concerns them and explain why your product/service will be an improvement.\n \t<li><b>“I need to check with my team first.”</b></li>\nMany prospects use this sales objection when they do not have decision-making power. In the case they do, they may want a second opinion or are not prioritizing the deal.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nRegardless of the reason, handling this sales objection is best done by requesting a call with the prospect’s team. Your buyer will more likely feel more confident when their boss or coworkers are involved.\n \t<li><b>“I need to check with my boss first.”</b></li>\nThis sales objection more clearly states the prospect does not have decision-making authority, and that may mean you are not speaking to the correct person. Or, they may just not be prioritizing the deal and do not want to make a decision.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nConfirm the correct person in the company to communicate with. Once you have contact with that individual, ask them questions more and explain features less.\n \t<li><b>“I don’t have the authority to sign off on this.”</b></li>\nLike delegating to their boss, prospects will use this sales objection when they do not have the authority or are not motivated to close a deal. This sales objection could also indicate they are concerned with the terms of the contract.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nAsk the prospect for the correct person to speak with. Determine if this person is satisfied with contractual terms.\n \t<li><b>“We’re using [competitor] right now.”</b></li>\nHearing your prospect is already working with a rival can be unsettling. However, this sales objection provides the opportunity for sales reps to assess how they match up against competitors and even lure prospects away from them.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nAsk the prospect why they chose the competitor. Listen to what they like and don’t like. Express what your product/service can do better than who they currently work with.\n \t<li><b>“I am happy with [competitor] right now.”</b></li>\nClosing a deal with a prospect who uses this sales objection may be the most difficult feat. Buyers most likely will not choose another product if they are currently satisfied.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nAsk the prospect what components they are most impressed with their current product. Try to discuss with the prospect how you can still offer a lower price or higher value with your product/service.\n \t<li><b>“[competitor] says [false negative statement about your product/service].”</b></li>\nWhen contacts choose to use this sales objection, they are signaling that their perception of your company/product has been affected by a rival’s testament. The prospect is interested but is also concerned your rival’s comments are true.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nRespond with a simple “That’s not true.” Prospects will typically move on. If that is not enough to change their mind, provide background information that refutes the false claim. Avoid responding by making negative claims about the competitor.\n \t<li><b>“I am signed to a contract with [competitor].”</b></li>\nWhen using this sales objection the prospect believes their hands are tied. This warrants the opportunity for your company to be of their assistance.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nAsk the prospect about the status of their relationship with the competitor and how they feel about their current contractual terms. Determine if you can offer them a discount for exiting their contract. Illustrate how their ROI can alleviate the setback from the sunk cost.\n \t<li><b>“[competitor] is offering a similar product/service for a smaller price.”</b></li>\nProspects that lack background knowledge of the product/service may use this sales objection because they are unaware of how lower pricing can mean lower value. On the contrary, seasoned prospects may use this sales objection in a more competitive situation.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nIf the prospect does not have enough intel, shift the focus of the product/service’s price over to work. If they do, consider offering a discount but continue to sell value.\n \t<li><b>“I do not see an ROI.”</b></li>\nIf your prospect cannot visualize the results from purchasing, they may choose to use this sales objection. The prospect wants to see your pitch align with hard statistics.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nPrepare a formal pitch to the prospect or their manager. In this pitch, provide forecasts that illustrate the ROI the prospect should anticipate.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><b>Also Read: </b><a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/sales-forecasting/\"><b>How To Forecast Sales?</b></a></p>\n\n \t<li><b>“This is a scam.”</b></li>\nSmall businesses and startup companies who propose new ideas are likely to hear this sales objection. A prospect is less likely to make a purchase in your product/service unless they have evidence of ROI.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nTake the time to explain with the prospect how your product/service works. Use any testimonials from clients or case studies to prove your product/service is not a scam.\n \t<li><b>“Call me back next quarter.”</b></li>\nProspects will often use this sales objection if purchasing your product/service does not align with their current quarter goals. However, this objection at the very least gives you a specific time to respond.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nAsk the prospect what will change in their company’s next quarter. Highlight specific components of your product/service that best help accomplishes their next quarter objectives.\n \t<li><b>“I’m too busy right now.”</b></li>\nSales reps have to accept that their leads are always busy. When prospects use this sales objection they are either not prioritizing your product/service or are not interested in a full conversation.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nReassure the prospect that you are respectful of their time. Determine what is causing them to be busy and show them how your product/service can make their schedule less busy.\n \t<li><b>“I’m not interested.”</b></li>\nMany sales reps may choose to end the relationship when they hear this sales objection. However, a prospecting call is too far in the early stages for a prospect to decide if they are interested or not. They may not believe your product/service is relevant or vital to their business.\n\n<b>How To Solve?</b>\n\nAvoid immediately trying to change the prospect’s opinion. Let the prospect know you understand and offer to send information that can address business concerns.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><b>Also Read: </b><a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/what-is-conversational-ai/\"><b>How To Automate Conversational AI?</b></a></p>\n\n<h2><b>Types Of Objections In Sales</b></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>Lack of Need</b></li>\nBusinesses must be selective in making purchases, so prospects will not buy your product/service if they don’t believe they need it. This type of sales objection grants the opportunity for sales reps to learn about what current issues their business needs to address. By knowing this, sales reps can provide information on what components of their product/service will resolve their problems.\n \t<li><b>Lack of Budget</b></li>\nAlmost every sales call includes this type of sales objection. Prospects must be confident with the price they are paying because every purchase assumes potential financial burdens. Instead of selling the product/service’s price or lowering it, sales reps can respond to these types of sales objections by selling the product/service’s value.\n \t<li><b>Lack of Priority</b></li>\nThis type of sales objection is either used because the prospect does not have time or does not see buying your product/service as a primary concern. Sales reps should use this sales objection to gain information about where their priorities currently lie and determine if they can fit in their product/service. If the issue appears to be solely time-related, the best option is to schedule a follow-up call when they are available.\n \t<li><b>Lack of Trust</b></li>\nBuyers will usually prefer doing business with those they are already familiar with. This means sales reps must take sales calls as an opportunity to familiarize their prospect with both the company and product. Additionally, this type of sales objection calls for sales reps to sell the company’s positioning in the market.\n \t<li><b>Competition Interference</b></li>\n\nCompetition can sway a buyer’s opinion before sales reps make the call. If a prospect makes a sales objection that mentions a competitor, it is because they are likely deciding between your company and rivals. This should alert sales reps to shift their focus of the prospecting call on how your product/service is superior to its competitors.\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><b>Also Read: </b><a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/go-to-market-gtm-strategy/\"><b>How To Create A Go-To-Market Strategy?</b></a></p>\n\n<h2><b>Steps To Handling Sales Objections</b></h2>\nRegardless of the type of sales objection, all of them can be resolved with a similar framework. Here is a step-by-step plan for sales reps to refer to when faced with a sales objection:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Prepare for sales objections.</strong> As mentioned before, virtually no sales calls are made without sales objections. Come to the prospecting call anticipating certain sales objections and answers.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Listen to full objection(s).</strong> Focus on the concerns that the prospect details. Do so with the intention of empathizing with the prospect. Make sure your body language and facial expressions communicate that you take their objections seriously.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Ask for additional information.</strong> Request clarification on objections that may not be clear. Continue to ask “What else?” and “Why?” questions to get explanations and final information.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Validate the objection(s).</strong> Refrain from rejecting or minimizing the objection. Express to the prospect that their concerns are important to you.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Act on objection(s) appropriately.</strong> Attend to the objections quickly. Start with the most important objection and move on to smaller ones.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Discuss solutions to the objection(s).</strong> Propose a follow-up call with the prospect. In this call, repeat the objection and how you plan to overcome it.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Confirm the objection has been satisfied.</strong> Ask if they are happy with your solution. Inform them of any follow-up meetings or information that may be necessary.</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><b>Also Read: </b><a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/components-sales-enablement/\"><b>Important Components Of Sales Enablement</b></a></p>\n\n<h2><b>Why Is Objection Handling Important?</b></h2>\nMany sales reps can attest to the fact that a vast majority of sales calls made are met with at least one sales objection.\n\nBy overcoming sales objections your sales team can sway the opinions of prospective buyers who are on the fence about your product/service. A majority of the most common sales objections can be solved with common sales objective responses. With no sales objections, prospective customers will feel they have no reason not to invest in your product/service.\nHandling sales objections comes with a certain degree of urgency. Failing to address sales objections is one of the biggest threats to closing deals. If buyers continue to hold on to their objection through the final stages that objection will increase in its concern, which makes it more difficult to solve.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><b>Also Read: </b><a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/crm-automation-benefits/\"><b>Benefits Of Sales CRM Automation</b></a></p>\n\n<h4><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h4>\nAviso has the AI tools to help sales reps and managers in overcoming objections in sales.

Manual methods of record-keeping, such as spreadsheets, cannot help in scaling your business. A CRM tool not only helps your business grow but also makes your life much easier.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, things get complex when your contact list grows. It becomes too complicated to track your prospect information when you're dealing with a lot of data on your CRM and your team has to update and rely on it.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, how to keep your CRM system super efficient while your contact list grows?

		"content": "The worlds of revenue intelligence, revenue operations, and revenue execution are all converging at an unprecedented pace. The pandemic-driven shift to a digital selling model has driven more modern revenue teams than ever before to rely on next-generation AI and SaaS solutions to manage their deal intelligence, sales coaching, and forecasting processes.\n\nLeading analyst firm, Forrester, has just announced a new report in the new upcoming category of RO&amp;I – Revenue Operations and Intelligence, and Aviso is delighted to be featured in this category. Forrester acknowledges Aviso’s strengths as a leader in the growth stage maturity segment mentioned in the report.\n\nForrester defines revenue operations and intelligence solutions (RO&amp;I) as: “<i>Technologies that leverage buyer signals and interactions to produce insights that allow go-to-market functions to continuously improve execution performance and optimize the revenue engine across multiple areas: engagement and productivity, revenue cadence and forecasting, and the overall optimization of the revenue engine itself <a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/blogs/revenue-operations-intelligence-roi-is-now-core-to-a-go-to-market-tech-stack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">[1]</a>.</i>”\n\nThis further validates our approach that not only do revenue teams today need a single pane of glass across their revenue and GTM operations, but they also need a new kind of revenue engine to power their future growth. Aviso’s time-series AI engine was the first of its kind in the industry, designed for this world where self-driving revenue operations and human intelligence co-exist together to maximize revenue potential. Several of our customers such as RingCentral and FireEye have relied on Aviso’s AI engine now for nearly 7 years for their revenue work.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/report/new-tech-revenue-operations-and-intelligence-q4-2021/RES176449\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> covers five key trends that buyers should consider as core capabilities by solution providers in the RO&amp;I space. We also describe how Aviso’s predictive AI approach to implementing these capabilities have helped global Fortune 500 leaders succeed at scale:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Real-time performance management of the revenue process.</strong> Similar to the world of IT, where monitoring and observability technologies help companies manage operations better, effective RO&amp;I solutions should help with the cross-functional measurement of revenue activities and outputs. Most revenue execution vendors are unable to do this beyond the sales function. Aviso’s whole-body approach optimizes the revenue process from Sales to Finance to Marketing to Customer Success with <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/deal-intelligence/\">deal-level forecasting and insights</a>, integrating with different GTM systems of record and engagement. Aviso’s AI Adaptive Metrics helps leaders with real-time analytics that go beyond traditional reporting, and help answer advanced <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/revops/\">revenue operations</a> questions.</li></br>\n \t<li><strong>Deal forensics is key to a repeatable and scalable process. </strong>Going beyond just CRM activity inputs, the analysis of sales teams' activities has become critical to sustaining deal momentum. Most deal insight vendors stop at basic CRM-captured insights. At Aviso, we believe insights are only part of the puzzle and <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/deal-guidance/\">deal-specific guidance</a> and AI-guided actions are essential to close the revenue loop. Aviso achieves this by complementing insights with contextual nudges and actionable recommendations. With GPS like step-by-step deal guidance, teams can implement repeatable playbooks.</li></br>\n \t<li><strong> Higher value engagement helps drive more deal conversions. </strong>With more and more customers buying B2B software virtually, a better buying experience is a key differentiator for successful deals. However, most engagement tracking vendors stop at tracking email and calendar activities. Buyer engagement at Aviso measures both the quality and quantity of interactions on email and calendars and voice and video interactions. Aviso's <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/conversational-intelligence/\">Conversational Intelligence</a> (CI) also tracks intent, helping teams truly understand the impact of words and implicit actions on either winning or losing a deal with advanced deep learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms.</li></br>\n \t<li><strong>More predictable revenue is achieved using transparent accountability. </strong>Accountability needs to exist across the deal tracking and forecasting process. However, most engagement vendors cannot do predictive forecasts, and most forecast vendors offer weak engagement workflows. Aviso is the only AI platform that combines the world’s most sophisticated, collaborative forecasting with support for complex rollups, hierarchies, and overlays, alongside proprietary WinScore(™) deal probabilities, <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/pipeline-acceleration/\">pipeline</a> quality inspection, and integrated deal and forecast collaboration rooms.</li></br>\n \t<li><strong>Improved buyer and buying group intelligence are critical. </strong>As both B2B buying and selling turn into team sports, identifying both known decision-makers and hidden influencers in the buying process is crucial. However, most relationship intelligence vendors aren’t able to leverage this capability fully because they cannot even predict which composition of deals will make a quarter’s forecast. Aviso’s AI activity and relationship intelligence uniquely track every key person in a deal and their interactions in the context of a deal’s forecasted risks and calculations, all of which feed the same time-series database engine that helps measure the real-time revenue cycle performance.</li>\n</ol>\nThe COVID-19 pandemic triggered the digital transformation of sales as buyer engagement became completely digital. According to Forrester, the RO&amp;I market saw rapid growth with increased buyer interest in RO&amp;I solutions. Billions of dollars are already invested into this category so far in 2021. Since 2017, the investment in this category has grown rapidly with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 58 percent up to August 2021.\n\nAviso’s Integrated Revenue Operations and Intelligence Platform offers the most comprehensive set of tools that drive revenue intelligence and actions across sales, marketing, and customer success teams. With Aviso, you get the best self-driving revenue engine that augments seller intelligence and uncovers the hidden revenue opportunity from each customer.\n\nAs new customers are onboarded, Aviso bootstraps history from the source systems, and the AI engine discovers the most predictive features for that customer. Our platform is super flexible and scalable to configure any complex customer hierarchies (or sales processes). Aviso helps go-to-market revenue teams close more sales deals with 98%+ forecast accuracy, drive better revenue growth, and reduce risk with an AI guidance platform for virtual selling and is used by leading Fortune 500 companies and global brands such as Honeywell, Venafi, Microsoft Github, and Marlin Equity Partners.\n\nLearn more about Aviso and our Revenue Operations and Intelligence solution <strong><a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/platform/\">here</a></strong>.",

		"image": "https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Blog-Header-QBRs.jpg",
		"content": "A sales Quarterly Business Review (QBR) is an open forum for sales teams to show their strategic planning and critical thinking skills. Though it is a routine process in most sales-driven organizations, it still involves a lot of effort and planning. Let us understand what a sales QBR is, how to conduct it, and some best practices you can incorporate.\n<h2><strong>What Is A Sales Quarterly Business Review (QBR)?</strong></h2>\nA sales Quarterly Business Review (QBR) is an opportunity for sales leaders such as sales managers, sales operations, senior sales leadership, etc. to review the previous quarter's performance. It allows sales managers to show the last quarter's results to their leadership or a wider audience, project the forecasts, and plan for future quarters.\n\nA sales QBR aims to deep dive into everything that occurred in the previous quarter and creates actionable strategies for the next quarter. It is also an opportunity for the reps to showcase their key skills and explain their plan to meet quotas. For the sales manager, a QBR serves as a forum to praise the reps, provide constructive criticism, and offer actionable advice.\n<h2><strong>Importance Of Quarterly Business Reviews</strong></h2>\nSales organizations work best with accurate feedback from their reps. While weekly discussions are important, sales QBRs provide more depth and insights to plan for the bigger picture. Hence, the importance of sales QBRs include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Helps determine and plan long-term company goals and objectives</li>\n \t<li>Shows how an individual sales executive or territory manager’s performance contributes to the company objectives</li>\n \t<li>Helps set up accurate promotional guidelines</li>\n \t<li>Provides deeper level feedback that helps with current projects as well as future advancement</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/components-sales-enablement/\">Sales Enablement Best Practices</a></strong></p>\n<h2><strong>How To Conduct Sales Quarterly Business Review?</strong></h2>\nFollow these steps to conduct an effective sales quarterly review:\n\n<ol>\n \t<h4><li><b>Gather all the relevant sales reports:</b></h4>\n\nPreparation is the key to a sales QBR. As a sales manager, your presentation must be detailed and data-driven. Put all your facts and figures in the presentation. Use your CRM to export all the relevant reports (such as QoQ reports by close rate, sales revenue, etc.) and note down what went right and what needs improvement.\n\n</li>\n \t<h4><li><b>Always include sales forecasts:</b></h4>\nThough QBRs showcase your performance for the previous quarter, try to show the upcoming results to your audience. Tell about the goals you plan to achieve in the future, areas of improvement, and expected <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/sales-forecasting/\">sales projections</a>. Tell me why these matter and what is your plan to achieve them.\n</li>\n \t<h4><li><b>Prepare a visually attractive presentation:</b></h4>\nA visually attractive and engaging presentation helps support your QBR by driving everyone's attention quickly. Use visuals such as charts, diagrams, icons, and graphs to display your data with clarity. As work presentations often get tedious, it helps to present your data that is neatly arranged and visually appealing.\n\n</li>\n \t<h4><li><b>Show the big picture:</b></h4>\nAlong with daily operations, showing the big picture is also essential in sales QBR. Including strategies that support company goals helps show the leadership about your company-wide thinking skills and growth mindset.\n\n</li>\n \t<h4><li><b>Stick to strategy and avoid tactics:</b></h4>\nKeep your sales QBR a high-level review that focuses on performance, progress towards goals, potential roadblocks, and future opportunities. You can schedule a separate time for any other operational matters, else your QBR will become a problem-solving mess.\n\n</li>\n \t<h4><li><b>Keep it short and crisp:</b></h4>\nAn effective sales QBR agenda is usually short, without any useless information. Be mindful of your manager's and the audience's time while preparing QBRs. Try to keep things precise and to the point in your presentation.\n\n</li>\n \t<h4><li><b>Share the QBR in advance:</b></h4>\nAlways try to share your sales QBR agenda in advance with your audience before the presentation, so they can review and prepare their questions. If everyone is well prepared you can spend your time more productively.\n\n</li>\n \t<h4><li><b>Engage with your audience:</b></h4>\nUnderstanding your audience's mood is essential for all presentations, and a sales QBR is no different. Continuously check the engagement levels of your audience. If you see people losing interest, quicken up your presentation or insert some kind of enthusiasm, such as share a quick story or ask them any questions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/sales-pipeline-management/\">Importance of Sales Pipeline Management</a></strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Sales Quarterly Business Review Best Practices</strong></h2>\nBelow are five best practices you can incorporate for effective sales QBRs within your sales org:\n<ol>\n \t<h4><li><b>Keep The QBR Process As Simple As Possible:</b></h4>\nTry to keep the sales QBR meeting simple, but relevancy is critical. Both the sales manager and the sales rep must use the same data for preparing the presentation. Also, do not force your team to spend hours looking for data. Instead, allow them to spend their time to analyze and understand how they can support business goals.\n\n</li>\n \t<h4><li><b>Deploy Multi-Level QBRs:</b> </h4>\nFor the QBR process to be effective, you need to deploy multiple levels of performance reviews. Start with your front-line sales manager who can review their sales reps. After that, depending upon the sales management levels in your sales org, each level should conduct QBRs at their level. For example, regional sales directors should conduct QBRs with sales managers, and Sales VPs should conduct QBRs with regional sales directors.\n\n</li>\n \t<h4><li><b>Commit To The QBR Process:</b></h4>\nFor an effective sales QBR process to work in favor of the organization, the sales leadership must commit to performing QBR reviews every quarter without fail. Though it takes a lot of commitment and discipline, if you miss QBRs in any quarter then you'll lose on all the previous effort and positive impact.\n\n</li>\n \t<h4><li><b>Set Up Clear Roles and Expectations:</b></h4>\nThe real goal of sales QBRs is to review performance and support business goals. For example, a sales manager's role should not be to catch the sales representatives but help with business thinking. Hence, it is critical to set up clear expectations of every individual's role in the QBR process.\n</li>\n \t<h4><li><b>Incorporate A Coaching Mindset:</b></h4>\nAs a sales leader, make sure you incorporate a coaching mindset within your sales org to drive a performance culture. The coaching skill helps facilitate the problem-solving process during QBRs. Believe that your reps have the solution. Ask as many curious and relevant questions from reps rather than telling them your viewpoint or what they should do.</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/go-to-market-gtm-strategy/\">How To Develop A Go To Market Strategy</a></strong></p>\n<h2><strong>What Are The Sales Metrics To Include In Your QBRs?</strong></h2>\nBelow are the sales metrics that you should focus on for an effective sales QBR meeting.\n\n<b>Past:</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Win rate / Closed deals</li>\n \t<li>Missed or slipped deals</li>\n \t<li>Attainment</li>\n \t<li>Lost deals (that were earlier in commit)</li>\n \t<li>Sales linearity</li>\n \t<li>Average sales cycle</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Present:</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Missed or slipped deals</li>\n \t<li>Average sales cycle</li>\n \t<li>Engagement rate</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Future:</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Pipeline coverage</li>\n \t<li>Best-case pipeline</li>\n \t<li>Commit deals</li>\n \t<li>Most-likely deals</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/what-is-conversational-ai/\">How Does Conversational AI Work?</a></strong></p>\n<h2><strong>QBR Templates And Examples</strong></h2>\nA sales QBR template serves as a planner that shows and supports you on how a sales QBR presentation is done.

		"content": "<b><i>Using Sentiment Analysis, businesses can gauge customer sentiment more accurately and win deals, every time!</i></b>\n\nIn 2021, businesses have become adept at acquiring customer engagement data. However, an over-reliance on these data points often leads to the same businesses designating customer feedback as a mere metric -- a very one-dimensional way of listening to the voice of the customer. The voice of the customer cannot be badged and translated into just a number. It must be read, distilled, and most importantly, understood.\n\nThe truth is, brands need to actively listen to what their customers are saying on every channel they engage with them on - be it calls, emails, or live chat. Monitoring and analyzing the sentiment behind customer feedback should be every brand’s priority, but brands have long struggled to process this data and turn it into actionable insight.\n\nWith Sentiment Analysis, that’s no longer the case.\n\n<b>Here is what we’re covering in this article:</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>What Is Sentiment Analysis?</li>\n \t<li>Benefits Of Sentiment Analysis</li>\n \t<li>Different Types Of Sentiment Analysis</li>\n \t<li>How Does Sentiment Analysis Work?</li>\n \t<li>Applications of AI Sentiment Analysis In Business</li>\n \t<li>Challenges In Sentiment Analysis</li>\n \t<li>How Aviso's Sentiment Analysis works</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>What Is Sentiment Analysis? </b></h2>\nSentiment analysis--also known as conversation mining-- is a technique that lets you analyze ​​opinions, sentiments, and perceptions. In a business context, Sentiment analysis enables organizations to understand their customers better, earn more revenue, and improve their products and services based on customer feedback.\n\nThe difference between a software system capable of analyzing customer sentiment and a salesperson/customer support rep trying to deduce it is the former’s sheer ability to derive <b>objective </b>results from raw text -- This is primarily done through natural language processing (<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/natural-language-processing#:~:text=Natural%20language%20processing%20(NLP)%20refers,same%20way%20human%20beings%20can.\">NLP</a>), and Machine learning techniques.\n\nNow that we’ve broadly defined what Sentiment Analysis (SA) is, and how it can help businesses understand customer pulse and play the prospecting game better, let’s delve deep into how it actually works, the overarching benefits of SA, and the intricacies/challenges behind it.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/sales-forecasting/\">How To Forecast Sales Accurately</a></strong></p>\n\n<h2><b>Key Benefits Of Sentiment Analysis:</b></h2>\nHere are the important benefits of sentiment analysis you can’t overlook.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Gives your ear-to-the ground user feedback to improve your product</li>\n \t<li>Enables better prospecting and an increase in sales revenue</li>\n \t<li>Improves upselling opportunities among your product’s champions</li>\n \t<li>Enables proactive customer service</li>\n \t<li>Help understand your brand’s perception with your audience.</li>\n</ul>\nNumbers can give you the raw performance of a particular marketing campaign, engagement levels in a prospecting call, and the number of tickets pending from a customer support perspective. But it won’t tell you why a particular scenario happened and the exact reason behind it. For example, analytics tools like Google and Facebook can help you measure the success of your marketing efforts but they don’t give you an in-depth understanding of why that particular campaign was successful. In this aspect, Sentiment Analysis can be a game-changer.\n\nSentiment analysis helps fill these gaps by telling you how your customers perceive your brand/product. This can give you a huge edge in crafting a highly targeted marketing strategy that resonates with your audience, polishing that follow-up pitch with a high-value prospect, or even helping understand customer pain points through the tone of their emails, thereby drastically reducing Mean Time to resolve (MTTR).\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/go-to-market-gtm-strategy/\">How To Build A Go To Market Strategy</a></strong></p>\n\n<h2><b>Types Of Sentiment Analysis</b></h2>\nTypically SA models focus on polarity (positive, negative, neutral) as a go-to metric to gauge sentiment. But sentiments can also be tailored to fit specific use-cases and needs of a business, For example, a customer service rep would glean customer satisfaction insights from the tone of an email, or the mood of the customer on a call, whereas a sales rep might need to know the engagement levels of a prospect (engaged or disengaged) from a particular meeting they had, so they can plan their next follow-up and close the deal.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_11420\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"304\"]<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-11420\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Types-Of-Sentiment-Analysis-304x300.jpg\" alt=\"Types Of Sentiment Analysis\" width=\"304\" height=\"300\" /> Types Of Sentiment Analysis[/caption]\n\nHere are some of the most popular types of Sentiment Analysis methods:\n<ol>\n \t<h4><li><strong>Standard Sentiment Analysis:</strong></li></h4>\n\nThis is one of the most common types of Sentiment Analysis since it recognizes the overall tone of a written text and classifies it as positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nSome common examples of text and how categorization happens:\n\n<ul>\n \t<li>'I love how Facebook connects people around the world ' → Positive</li>\n \t<li>“I still need to see if the Facebook messenger is actually useful to me or not' → Neutral</li>\n \t<li>“Facebook is so confusing to me, it is not intuitive at all' → Negative</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n \t<h4><li><strong>Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis:</strong></li></h4>\n\nThis method employs a more elaborate polarity range and can be used if businesses want to get a more precise understanding of customer sentiment/feedback. The response gathered is categorized into the sentiment that ranges from 5-stars to a 1-star.\n\n<ul>\n \t<li>Very positive - 5 stars</li>\n \t<li>Positive - 4 stars</li>\n \t<li>Neutral - 3 stars</li>\n \t<li>Negative - 2 stars</li>\n \t<li>Very negative - 1 star</li>\n</ul>\n\n \t<h4><li><strong>Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis:</strong></li></h4>\n\nWhile fine-grained analysis helps you determine the overall polarity of your customer reviews, aspect-based analysis delves deeper. It helps you determine the particular aspects (attributes or components) of a product people are talking about.\n\nImagine you’re a salesperson selling a project management solution, you had a meeting with a prospect and are convinced that the meeting went well, but running the recording of the meeting through a Sentiment Analysis tool can reveal the actual subtext behind certain statements.\n\nTake this phrase for example: “This solution definitely fits within our budget, even though our IT teams could find the API infrastructure a bit tricky to scale. I will be happy to talk to other stakeholders and see if we can move things forward” - even though this might be construed as largely positive by the salesperson, a SA tool can help deduce the negative sentiment associated with the phrase, and the possibility of the deal falling through.\n</ol>\nWith aspect-based analysis, you can determine that the prospect has said something “negative” about your “API infrastructure scaling well in the long-term”, you can quickly act on this by setting up a meeting with your solution engineers and making sure queries around your product are addressed.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/revenue-forecasting/\">Best Revenue Forecasting Models</a></strong></p>\n\n<h3><b>How Does Sentiment Analysis Work Under The Hood?</b></h3>\nThere is a myriad of techniques and methods that are used to analyze sentiment, this differs from one organization to another based on their needs. Sentiment analysis works by using Machine learning and its constituent Deep learning algorithms to create SA models. These models are trained by feeding it millions of pieces of text to detect if a message is positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis works by breaking a message down into topic chunks and then assigning a sentiment score to each topic.\n\nFor example, take the following piece of text:\n\n“I tried Dispo, a social sharing app. I was really impressed with it. The\n‘Rolls’ feature was a little disappointing, but the user experience was amazing”\n\nA sentiment analysis tool would break this into topic chunks and then assign a sentiment score to each topic, based on a set scale:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Dispo social sharing app, I was really impressed = +4</li>\n \t<li>The ‘Rolls’ feature was a little disappointing = -2</li>\n \t<li>The user experience was amazing = +3</li>\n</ul>\nThe system would then sum up the scores or use each score individually to evaluate components of the statement. In this case, there was an overall positive sentiment of +5, but a negative sentiment towards the ‘Rolls feature’.\n<h2><b>Tips For Sentiment Analysis: </b></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Use SA to track negative sentiment towards your brand. This not only lets you fix your product/service but also enables you to understand how customer sentiment towards your brand changes over time.</li>\n \t<li>Track key topics that are relevant to your business</li>\n \t<li>Gauge where your audience spends most of their time, and what type of content they are engaging with, track sentiment across the web, and come up with content that speaks to your audience.</li>\n \t<li>Purpose-built Sentiment Analysis tools can help you understand your audience better and save you the hassle of experimenting with what works and what doesn't. Investing in one would enable you to focus on making your overall processes better.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/sales-pipeline-management/\">Importance of Sales Pipeline Management</a></strong></p>\n\n<h2><b>Applying Sentiment Analysis To Business: </b></h2>\nIn essence, Sentiment analysis equips you with an understanding of how your customers perceive your brand. Apart from the CS tickets, live chats, and user feedback your business gets on the daily, the internet itself can be an opinion minefield for your audience. Being able to not just access these opinions, but process them at scale, and get an overall understanding of your market presence, is a key advantage for any business looking to improve their products, selling process, and brand presence.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_11421\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"481\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-11421\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Applying-Sentiment-Analysis-To-Business.jpg\" alt=\"Applying Sentiment Analysis To Business\" width=\"481\" height=\"267\" /> Applying Sentiment Analysis To Business[/caption]\n\nHere are some important business functions that could use Sentiment Analysis in their operations:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Sales:</li>\n</ul>\nEvery savvy salesperson has their own theories, instincts, and experiences that they rely on to engage prospects and close deals. Relying on these traits leaves a lot to gut instinct and luck. AI sentiment analysis can help change this, and enable the salesperson to take the guesswork out of their prospecting calls.\n\nSentiment Analysis tools can parse through meeting transcripts and give you the overall tone, and sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of the entire call. Moreover, SA tools can help pinpoint keywords, competitor mentions, pricing references, and so much more -- information that could be the differentiator between a salesperson winning or losing a deal.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Customer Service:</li>\n</ul>\nAccording to a study, <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/advisory-services/publications/consumer-intelligence-series/pwc-consumer-intelligence-series-customer-experience.pdf#page=8\">32% of customers</a> stop using a product or brand after one bad customer service experience. With the increase in the number of channels customers can reach brands on, the risk of one bad experience becomes multifold. The ability to track brand sentiment across the web can keep CX teams in the know about what’s coming their way. For example: if an aspect of your product has been criticized on an online forum, your customer support team can even use those opinions to put together an emergency plan to tackle them.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Brand Outlook Monitoring:</li>\n</ul>\nBesides social media, people talk about brands in blogs, news sites, forums, and product reviews. And while it’s alright to track brand mentions (in terms of quantity), it’s even more important to analyze <i>how</i> they are talking about you.\n\nSentiment analysis can add valuable context to quantitative metrics and help you understand the nuances of customer opinions. You can analyze brand sentiment over time and notice any sudden changes in them. You can also track public sentiment to assess the impact of a PR crisis on your brand and evaluate whether your efforts to handle the situation were successful.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Market Research:</li>\n</ul>\nSentiment analysis can be very useful to analyze your competitors, spot market trends, and conduct market research. You can analyze sentiment in product review sites, social media posts, and community forums about your competition to learn about their strengths and weaknesses. Where do they excel that you may need to work on? Are your competitors not doing something that you can execute to gain more market share? - are some of the questions Sentiment Analysis helps deduce and answer.\n\nAlso, you can follow specific keywords or hashtags and monitor sentiment around topics that are relevant to your industry. This can help you detect market trends or measure interest around certain topics to gain a competitive advantage.<b></b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Human Resources:</li>\n</ul>\nIt is as important to listen to the voice of your employees, as you do from your customers. Employee productivity directly ties to your business’s revenue. Hence it is critical that you actively source feedback from your employees about the product, company culture, and processes in place.\n\nBusinesses can use Sentiment analysis tools to analyze internal surveys to weed out organizational and operational issues that are impacting the workforce. This allows your employees to be heard, which is crucial for any company.\n<h2><b>Challenges In Sentiment Analysis:</b></h2>\nOne of the most important challenges around Sentiment analysis is that companies usually struggle with is the accuracy with which they are able to gauge customer and prospect sentiment. Moreover, there are complementary factors like bias and context that make SA a challenge to implement at scale. Sentiment analysis can be difficult simply because machines have to be trained to analyze and understand emotions like humans do.\n\nHere are some of the major pitfalls that a business might face while trying to analyze sentiment:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Irony and sarcasm</li>\n</ul>\nIn a sarcastic text, people express their negative sentiments using positive words. Here is an example of a tweet from an irate customer: “I love how robust their tool is, I probably experience only 5 hrs of downtime a day “\n\nExpressing negative sentiment using compliments can make it tough for SA tools to detect sarcasm and irony, especially without having a good understanding of the context of the situation. The solution for this problem is in training a SA model dataset that not only has to be precise but also needs to be exhaustive.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Tonality of text:</li>\n</ul>\nTone can be difficult to interpret verbally, and even more difficult to figure out in a text. The most important challenge for businesses and brands is to differentiate between subjective sentiment (i.e: I personally don’t like pizza) and objective sentiment (i.e That car is red in color).\n\nBrands predominantly look for subjective reviews and opinions on the web, so they can understand how they are perceived among their audience. For example: “I love the tool, but my budget does not” is a text that can be interpreted as “The cost of the tool makes me consider it less”. This is a subjective response that a SA tool can struggle to categorize, and when a large volume of data that contains tonal responses like these are analyzed, things can get tricky.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Multipolarity</li>\n</ul>\nContext is critical. Even if you're speaking to a person, you'd have trouble continuing the conversation if you didn't have context. One of the problems that can arise due to lack of context is changes in polarity. A question like “What do you like the most in our tool” can elicit responses like “Everything” and “Nothing”, whereas the same responses can fit into a question like “What do you dislike the most in our tool” -- the negative in the question changes the context and by extension, the sentiment altogether.\n\nIn addition to these challenges above, there are some limitations in understanding negation in text, comparative sentences, defining neutral, etc. The good news is, as data and machine learning continue to evolve, sentiment analysis tools are becoming well suited to tackle these issues better.\n\nTo Summarize, Sentiment analysis is a great way to understand the opinion or feeling of a customer. It has its own set of challenges and limitations but is currently improving at a rapid pace. Nevertheless, sentiment analysis is an excellent way to obtain unbiased opinions from customers and can help improve your business across verticals like sales, marketing, and customer service.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/components-sales-enablement/\">Components of Sales Enablement</a></strong></p>\n\n<h3><b>Frequently Asked Questions:</b><b></b></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Is sentiment analysis ML or AI?</b></li>\n</ul>\nMachine learning is a subset of Artificial intelligence. Artificial Intelligence is an overarching term that finds its applications in ML, Deep Learning, Neural networks, and the like. Sentiment Analysis would fall under the ML umbrella since it has a lot to do with identifying patterns and predicting outcomes. <b></b>\n<ul>\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Who uses sentiment Analysis?</b></li>\n</ul>\nMany organizations and brands deal with customer opinion and feedback on the daily, thanks to social networks, and other customer interaction channels. Human analysts have limited time to process and analyze these data manually, hence Sentiment Analysis is most often used by businesses to gauge audience perception of their brand.<b></b>\n<ul>\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>How accurate is sentiment analysis?</b></li>\n</ul>\nAccuracy of a sentiment analysis tool or a model varies across domains and the datasets it's been trained on. But the good news is, sentiment analysis models get better and better with time as they are able to ingest varied data values and learn from them. State-of-the-art approaches have achieved as high as 97% accuracy levels on benchmark datasets.<b></b>\n<ul>\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Which model is best for sentiment analysis?</b></li>\n</ul>\nThere are traditional machine learning approaches like Naive Bayes, Logistic regression, and support vector machines that scale really well. However, In recent years, Deep learning has been popularly used in Sentiment Analysis. Deep Learning helps in context-aware sentiment classification. But, the choice of model depends on the business, domain, and the use case you are solving for. <b></b>\n<ul>\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Which is the best approach for sentiment analysis? </b></li>\n</ul>\nApproach depends on the use case, availability of corpus data, and technology constraints. If annotated corpus data is available, machine learning models can be trained to classify the sentiment associated. If enough corpus data is not available pre-trained Deep Learning models can be leveraged and fine-tuned with domain-specific data for improved performance.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/what-is-conversational-ai/\">How Does Conversational AI Work?</a></strong></p>\n\n<h2><b>Aviso AI's Sentiment Analysis</b></h2>\nHere at Aviso, we are at the frontier of leveraging Sentiment analysis to aid businesses with their sales process.

Or something else?\n\nYeah, those are a few attributes of successful sales reps and GTM teams. But it doesn’t mean you become overdependent on these characteristics. Sales reps need vital information that will help sell their product or service to its maximum potential. This calls for sales enablement, which has been proven to help sales reps attain the tools necessary to sell their products and services.\n<h2><b>What Is Sales Enablement?</b></h2>\nSales enablement is the strategic and ongoing process of providing your various business teams with the necessary information, training, and resources to close deals.\n\nIn simpler terms, sales enablement is providing the best materials to succeed. As great as professional athletes like Michael Jordan or Tom Brady are, they were better able to perform with upgraded equipment, footwear, and training facilities. This same concept can be applied towards sales enablement; if our business teams consistently receive sales enablement tools, sales growth will expedite.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/revenue-forecasting/\">Best Revenue Forecasting Models</a></span></strong></p>\n\n<h2><b>Importance Of Sales Enablement</b></h2>\n<a href=\"https://learn.g2.com/sales-enablement-statistics\">Statistics</a> say 76% of organizations experience about 6-20% growth in their sales as a result of sales enablement. Also, organizations with sales enablement achieve a 49% win rate on their forecasted deals, compared to 42.5% for businesses without it.\n\nThe importance of sales enablement falls in the reiterated concept that salespeople are more likely to succeed in closing deals if they have the necessary tools, knowledge, practice, and resources. The benefits that can occur from using a sales enable strategy includes but is not limited to the following:\n<ul>\n<li><h4><b>Preparation:</b></h4>\nHaving your business team prepared is a key component of the sales enablement process. This includes all facets in which companies train their employees. Some of these strategies include onboarding, coaching, and module-based training. This sales enablement strategy covers everything sales reps and leaders need to know, such as product knowledge and messaging.</li>\n<li><h4><b>Communication:</b></h4></li>\nIt is not just employees that work in the background that need sales enablement tools; other team members such as sales engineers and customer success will also need vital information to communicate with buyers. The most important tools those team members will need are important product knowledge and go-to dialogue.\n<li><h4><b>Insights:</b></h4></li>\nWhen your business attains sales enablement tools, it reveals your business's true sales potential. The results of understanding this potential output are various marketing insights. This is because now we have the necessary information needed to know what exactly causes deals to accelerate and what causes them to slow. This is important because it creates a roadmap for how to improve your sales process.\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/sales-forecasting/\">How To Forecast Sales?</a></span></strong></p>\n<h2><b>Important Components Of Sales Enablement</b></h2>\nSales enablement is necessary for the success of any sales and revenue organization. But it must have some essential components. Here are the important sales enablement components. \n<ul>\n \t<li>A complete plan for learning and coaching</li>\n \t<li>Up to date content</li>\n \t<li>The right tools and technology</li>\n \t<li>Strategic initiatives aligned to business goals</li>\n \t<li>Reporting and analysis</li>\n \t<li>Putting the right leader in charge</li>\n \t<li>Define Roles and Responsibilities</li>\n \t<li>Regulate operating processes and maintain check-ins</li>\n \t<li>Sales performance metrics</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<h3><b><li>A complete plan for learning and coaching</b></h3>\nTo implement a sales enablement strategy effectively in your GTM organization you will need a robust learning and coaching process. This requires creating an outline for the onboarding of sales reps that focuses on continuous learning.\n\nBy integrating a learning plan, your sales reps will develop the right soft skills and learn what’s needed to close a deal. They’ll understand your products, target markets, and buyer personas in detail.\n\nBut after the onboarding process the coaching plan is not done; your sales reps require regular learning sessions. This is done either through face-to-face meetings, videos, or online modules to sharpen their business acumen and remain competitive. Other than that, <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/sales-coaching/\">sales coaching</a> provides sales reps with continuous feedback and the right guidance to show stellar performance.\n\nAs a sales leader, you will need to monitor your team’s activities and jump in when necessary with the required coaching sessions. Your sales reps need coaching while closing a deal, not just when their learning calendar says so. Annual training programs are a thing of the past; need-based coaching will make your sales teams more successful.</li>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/go-to-market-gtm-strategy/\">How To Build A Go To Market Strategy?</a></span></strong></p>\n\n<h3><b><li>Up to date content</b></h3>\nContent is an important part of a successful sales enablement strategy. That’s because sales reps must provide value at each step of their interaction with customers, and for that, they must be armed with the best content. In addition, such content must be easily accessible to them.\n\nContent usually includes customized email templates, product description sheets, whitepapers, blog posts, and customer success stories. The more relevant and up-to-date content accessible to sales reps, the more confident and prepared they’ll be in dealing with their clients and prospects, build trust and relationships, and close deals.</li>\n\n<h3><b><li>The right tools and technology</b></h3>\nThough it’s possible to achieve desired results from a sales enablement strategy without using any tools, we’ll not advise it. That’s because there are a wealth of tools available that can change the game for your sales reps, without wasting their valuable time.\n\nThe market is flooded with thousands of such tools and technology platforms that boast to support your sales processes. Few examples are CRM tools, sales management tools, coaching tools, collaboration tools, and so on. Each tool offers different features and functionalities, and not every tool is meant for everyone.\n\nChoosing the right technology will help your sales reps close more deals by working efficiently and reducing the sales cycle. Invest in tools that suit your sales process, and reduce the burden of your sales reps instead of increasing their workload.</li>\n\n<h3><b><li>Strategic initiatives aligned to business goals</b></h3>\nA successful sales enablement strategy must be aligned with your organization’s vision and goals. You may have the best of coaching, content, and tools, but nothing will matter if your strategy isn’t aligned with your business goals.\n\nFor that, you’ll need to devise a well-thought-out strategy that includes key initiatives you need to take. You must take into account the unique attributes of your sales team and buyer personas. Just to give you an example, if you know at what stage of the sales process your sales reps struggle the most, it’ll help you provide the right coaching, or prepare the right content, or provide the right tool.\n\nSo, make sure you have real and meaningful talks with your sales reps to identify areas where they need the most support. You can also prepare a complete sales playbook document that covers everything your sales reps need, as a part of your sales enablement strategy.</li>\n\n<h3><b><li>Reporting and analysis</b></h3>\nThe current business world is driven by data. However, it is important to filter out what data is most relevant to avoid overwhelming sales reps. Some ways of getting the most out of data with sales enablement solutions include both a standard reporting system and identifying qualifying leads.\n\nWith a standard reporting system, your business will be able to easily understand the most important sales information. These metrics include leads generated or converted, pending actions from sales reps, and deals won or lost. This standardized reporting system allows companies to analyze weaknesses in the sales process that should be addressed by team leaders.\n\nBusinesses are often going to attract leads that would hurt the business more than help. To make the sales process easier, sales enablement tools will help determine qualifying leads or find leads suited to make business decisions with. Companies will implement a scoring system to determine how certain leads match up against others. Additionally, those businesses with CRM can discover the best fit leads immediately.</li>\n\n<h3><b><li>Put the right leader in charge</b></h3>\nOne of the most important parts of sales enablement companies is who’s in charge of the sales enablement process. A stronger leader should be able to do the following:\n\nBe able to pivot. To implement a sales enablement framework there must be communication between team members, and a leader should serve as a middle-man in this process.\n\nCommunicate! Leaders of any team must be able to deliver information to other team members clearly, and leaders of a sales enablement process must be able to additionally communicate with other employees in the company.\n\nThink like a sales rep. Authenticity is important in a sales process, so leaders must be able to understand the day-to-day life, interactions, and tools of sales leaders.</li>\n\n<h3><b><li>Define roles &amp; responsibilities</b></h3>\nYes, implementing sales enablement is in fact done in a team. Therefore, certain team roles are necessary to carry out this process. The Chief Enablement Officer manages the sales enablement strategies other members of the team are using. Along with the CEO is the VP of Sales Enablement, who assists in overseeing the sales enablement strategy with the CEO. The Director of Sales Enablement is responsible for turning these strategies into actual programs. \n\nThe Sales Enablement Manager takes these programs developed by the Director of Sales Enablement and delivers them to the field. \n\nThe Instructional Designer cultivates the onboarding and training courses for sales representatives. The Content Specialist discovers the most beneficial sales enablement tools to use. Finally, the Sales Coach helps sales representatives reach their maximum performance potential. All of these positions are covered in an effective sales enablement strategy. The roles should be picked based on the characteristics that a leader in a sales enablement company should possess.</li>\n\n<h3><b><li>Regular operating processes &amp; check-ins</b></h3>\nFor a sales enablement strategy to succeed, there must be communication about feedback between marketing and sales teams. \n\nSales teams must continuously provide insights on leads and customers that would be beneficial to the marketing team. The marketing team must constantly update content that would be useful in helping address concerns in the sales process.</li>\n\n<h3><b><li>Sales performance metrics</b></h3>\n<b><i>Finally, a sales enablement strategy is incomplete without metrics.</i></b> \n\nWell-defined sales performance metrics help you identify where your sales reps need the most help – coaching, tools, or content. Metrics also enable you to completely overhaul your existing strategy, just in case it doesn’t work out. A few examples of sales metrics include average deals size, win rate, sales productivity of reps/team, and average length of sales cycle. Metrics are useful to track and analyze how well your sales business is doing and to know what’s working well for you and whatnot.</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/sales-pipeline-management/\">Importance of Sales Pipeline Management</a></span></strong></p>\n<h2><b>How To Choose The Right Sales Enablement Software?</b></h2>\nThe right sales enablement software must be correctly chosen for your business dependent on the solutions it provides. The best way to do this is to assess such software's:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Content Management</li>\n \t<li>Content Creation</li>\n \t<li>Customer Engagement</li>\n \t<li>Presentation Management</li>\n \t<li>Sales Onboarding/Training/Coaching</li>\n \t<li>Sales Communication</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Sales Enablement Services And Solutions</b></h2>\nSales enablement is a rather new discipline adopted by software as a service (SaaS) and enterprise-sized businesses, but the goal of these companies is to implement sales enablement as a package. \n\nTo productize sales enablement, agencies must identify the best types of sales enablement tools and determine if these tools are one-time or recurring and should be sold as a product or on a retainer basis.\n<h2><b>Sales Enablement Frameworks</b></h2>\nA sales enablement framework consists of five pillars that cover each of the goals of a sales enablement strategy. The first one is the upgrading of technology or resources (often CRMs), which would boost the orchestration of sales. The second one is developing quality content, which helps the communication amongst marketing and sales. The third one is managing talent, which covers the idea of onboarding/coaching/evaluating employees. The fourth pillar is prioritizing customer satisfaction, which would optimize the buyer's journey. The final pillar of the sales enablement framework is having ongoing process efficiencies, which tackles the concern of team collaboration.\n<h3><b>Who Owns Sales Enablement?</b></h3>\nSales enablement is often owned jointly by your marketing and sales teams. These two teams must be able to collaborate for the sales enablement process to run smoothly. Marketing is responsible for both providing information as well as creating content for the sales team. Then, the sales team must put this sales enablement strategy into action. During this process, sales can communicate with marketing what content or materials they may need to share with leads throughout the buyer’s journey.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/what-is-conversational-ai/\">How Does Conversational AI Work?</a></span></strong></p>\n<h3><b>What Do Sales Enablement Teams Do All Day?</b></h3>\nIt may already be evident that sales enablement companies have plenty of work on their hands. These tasks and responsibilities that are distributed amongst the sales enablement team members include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Onboarding and coaching programs</li>\n \t<li>Creation of sales team assets and content</li>\n \t<li>Integration of the coaching strategy</li>\n \t<li>Sales communication</li>\n \t<li>Communication amongst marketing and sales teams</li>\n \t<li>Management of best sales enablement tools and processes</li>\n \t<li>Reports on the effectiveness of sales enablement services and performance</li>\n</ul>\nA strong sales enablement strategy is the key to sales success and maximizing potential.

		"content": "Do you want to transform your customers' buying experience and enhance sales using conversational AI? The technology will not only deliver a personalized experience to your customers but also enhance overall customer satisfaction. Conversational artificial intelligence is growing more prevalent each day. Whether you’re speaking to a voice assistant or interacting with a chatbot, technology is working behind the scenes to analyze what is being said (usually called “intent”), and build a suitable response.\n\n<strong>Here’s what we’ll cover in this article:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>What Is Conversational AI?</li>\n \t<li>Why Is Conversational AI Important?</li>\n \t<li>Types Of Conversational Intelligence</li>\n \t<li>How Does Conversational AI Work?</li>\n \t<li>Components Of Conversational Intelligence</li>\n \t<li>How To Implement Conversational Intelligence?</li>\n \t<li>How To Automate Conversational AI?</li>\n \t<li>Conversational AI Examples And Use Cases</li>\n \t<li>Aviso AI's Advanced Conversational Intelligence</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>What Is Conversational AI?</strong></h2>\nConversational artificial intelligence (AI) is a set of technologies that work behind voice-enabled and automated messaging applications to provide human-like interactions between humans and computers. It allows computers to understand, analyze, and respond to human text and speech inputs. Conversational artificial intelligence can understand human intent, decode different languages, and respond in a way that's similar to humans.\n\nThere's a lot of <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/conversational-intelligence/\">conversational intelligence</a></span> involved that works behind the technology. That's because human language consists of complex scenarios due to the involvement of multiple meanings of the same word, slang, clarifications, interruptions, etc. Human text, tone, voice, and gestures also need to be analyzed. Due to this, conversational intelligence provides capabilities that go beyond predefined paths.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/go-to-market-gtm-strategy/\">How To Build A Go To Market Strategy</a></span></strong></p>\n\n<h3><strong>Difference Between Conversational AI And Chatbots</strong></h3>\nThrough conversational AI and chatbots are often used interchangeably, they are not exactly the same. Here are the main differences between the two:\n<ul>\n \t<li>While conversational AI can process text and voice commands; chatbots can manage only text commands.</li>\n \t<li>Conversational intelligence can be deployed on voice assistants, websites, and smart speakers; chatbots can only be used as a chat interface.</li>\n \t<li>Conversational artificial intelligence considers natural language processing (NLP); chatbots work on pre-defined scripted conversation text flow.</li>\n \t<li>Conversational AI is focused on dialogue; chatbots are focused on navigation.</li>\n \t<li>Conversational intelligence can manage wide-scope and dynamic interactions; chatbots find it hard to manage out-of-scope tasks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Why Is Conversational AI Important?</strong></h2>\nOrganizations use conversational artificial intelligence in their sales, marketing, and customer support processes to offer a highly engaging customer journey. For instance, conversational AI for customer service helps organizations manage a lot of repetitive support tasks.\n\nAs conversational AI doesn’t depend on predefined scripts, it allows businesses to automate customized support for each customer. It helps make each interaction unique, reduces the resolution time, and enhances customer satisfaction.\n\nAlso, Conversational intelligence can be deployed in different customer service channels such as chat, voice, email, messaging, and social media. It allows organizations to scale their customer support to new channels to satisfy customer needs.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/sales-forecasting/\">How To Forecast Sales</a></span></strong></p>\n\n<h2><strong>4 Types Of Conversational Intelligence</strong></h2>\nHere are the different types of conversational AI that you can deploy in your organization:\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h4><strong>Chatbots:</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\nThese were introduced to automate customer support. You can find chatbots in various places such as websites, display advertising, and Facebook Messenger. They mostly respond to a customer's basic support queries and help them find products they want to buy.\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h4><strong>Voice Assistants:</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong><span style=\"font-weight: 500;\">These are similar to chatbots, but you need to speak out loud to interact with them. These mostly help you make phone calls, answer queries, set reminders, and alarms, play music, or provide weather updates. Examples are Amazon Alexa and Google Home.</span></strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h4><strong>Mobile Assistants:</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong><span style=\"font-weight: 500;\">These include Siri, Google Now, and others, and work similar to voice assistants. They help you perform tasks that need to be done quickly while you are doing something else such as driving or walking.</span></strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h4><strong>Interactive Voice Recognition Systems (IVRS):</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong><span style=\"font-weight: 500;\">These are used to automate customer service support and are used in contact centers. They help reduce service costs and enhance customer satisfaction.</span></strong>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/sales-pipeline-management/\">Importance of Sales Pipeline Management</a></span></strong></p>\n\n<h2><strong>How Does Conversational AI Work?</strong></h2>\nConversational AI works by combining machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and automated speech recognition (ASR) to analyze and contextualize the spoken and written words. It identifies and comes up with the best possible way to manage and respond to human input.\n\nConversational AI breaks down sentences to their root level. It pulls out human intent by determining patterns that it has been trained to find. It considers factors such as grammar, slang, synonyms, and more. Here, intent refers to what the human is trying to achieve.\n<h2><strong>Components Of Conversational Intelligence</strong></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversational AI includes four main components: input processing, input analysis, output generation, and reinforcement learning. These four components are explained below.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h4><b>Input Processing:</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A human provides text or voice input through an application or website. For spoken words, speech recognition converts voice into text for the computer to read.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h4><b>Input Analysis:</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The conversation engine uses NLP to decode the meaning and determine the intent of the text.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h4><b>Output Generation:</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The application builds a response based on the intent using Dialog Management. Then, NLP analyzes and converts the response into a format that's understood by humans.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h4><b>Reinforcement Learning:</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ML algorithms learn from the whole process and refine the response going forward to provide a better response in the future.</span>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/revenue-forecasting/\">Best Revenue Forecasting Models</a></span></strong></p>\n\n<h2><strong>How To Implement Conversational Intelligence?</strong></h2>\nTo implement conversational artificial intelligence services in your business, the best way to start is by integrating your existing systems (such as CRM or sales technologies) with NLP and ML. This will allow your technologies to accurately process customer interactions and automatically respond back with the most relevant answers. This will enhance your business processes, improve engagement with customers, and increase customer satisfaction.\n<h2><strong>How To Automate Conversational AI?</strong></h2>\nTo become an automated conversational AI company, you must automate all customer interactions (voice and text-based). For that, here is a list of action items you should do:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Use a low-code conversation editor to manage all conversations with a flexible interface.</li>\n \t<li>Deploy AI-based language understanding to get language support via NLP.</li>\n \t<li>Follow omnichannel integration strategy and deploy your bots on different channels.</li>\n \t<li>Integrate live chat with your contact center solution.</li>\n \t<li>Set up automated regression testing of all customer interactions to meet business objectives.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/accelerating-the-revenue-process/\">How To Accelerate Revenue Process</a></span></strong></p>\n\n<h2><strong>Conversational AI Examples And Use Cases</strong></h2>\nWhen talking about conversational AI examples, the most common things people have in their minds are AI-powered voice assistants and online chatbots. Below are a few use cases and examples of conversational AI across different industries:\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_11405\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-11405\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Conversational-AI-Examples-600x185.jpg\" alt=\"Conversational AI Examples\" width=\"600\" height=\"185\" /> Conversational AI Examples And Use Cases[/caption]\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h4><strong>Retail:</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\nFrom surfing a retailer website to buying products through a mobile app, conversational AI helps customers quickly find their desired product. AI-powered voice assistants help people navigate through different categories on websites, find products, and place the order. This helps improve the sales conversion rate and increase revenue for retailers.\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h4><strong>Banking:</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\nBanks need automated solutions to provide quick assistance to their customers. Conversational AI in banking helps banks provide customized support, and automate repetitive tasks such as the collection and processing of data. It helps improve customer engagement and understands customers' preferences.\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h4><strong>Healthcare:</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\nAI assistants help automate healthcare tasks such as collecting patients' data, scheduling appointments and sending appointment reminders. Some conversational AI solutions also help patients select the right healthcare plan and solve medication queries. This reduces a lot of human involvement and cuts the response time.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/components-sales-enablement/\">Components of Sales Enablement</a></span></strong></p>\nThe popularity of conversational artificial intelligence is growing for good reason. A growing number of organizations want to leverage AI to enhance their customers' buying experience. Conversational AI helps businesses scale their customer experiences by offering solutions to complex issues within seconds. So, what does this mean to you? As conversational intelligence becomes more common, your customers will expect it from you and your competitors will fill that gap. Businesses that ignore fast-growing technologies and fail to meet customer needs often get left behind.\n\nLeveraging AI to power customer interactions can enable sales by making the buying process more personalized, contextual, and simpler.

		"content": "How can I use technology to improve my revenue drive? This question has worked its way into every aspect of our lives, from everyday routines to inspiring value propositions. With so many aspects of the business world increasingly becoming tech-reliant, how does this affect revenue acceleration efforts? To understand the future of a key aspect of all industries and business ventures, let's first get into the basics.\n<h2><strong>What Is Revenue Acceleration?</strong></h2>\nRevenue acceleration is the process of coexistence between marketing, sales, and customer service in order to achieve a shared goal of driving revenue. Alignment through consistent communication, optimized tools, and a concise vision is essential to a successful revenue acceleration implementation. The next generation of revenue acceleration operations can be broken down into three main components.\n<h2><strong>Components Of Next-Gen Revenue Acceleration Operations</strong></h2>\nRegardless of the strategy for a revenue acceleration plan, you must have the following three components for a successful implementation:\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11190 size-full\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.5x-Gartner-Hype-Cycle-Infographic.png\" alt=\"Components of next gen. revenue operations: data, insights and actions\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" />\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Data:</strong></li>\n</ul>\nTo build a source of truth you can confidently base your business decisions on, and to free your teams from the shackles of manual input. Look at all the disparate data sets that are generated in a sales cycle and combine them into an opportunity-focused, deal-velocity-oriented view.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Insights:</strong></li>\n</ul>\nWith AI and a deep understanding of what drives revenue and people is ideal. Adopt a platform that allows sync with your CRM, email, and calendar to generate key insights to help your sales teams progress towards revenue acceleration goals.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Actions:</strong></li>\n</ul>\nEmpowering you and your teams to make the right decisions at the right time. Practicing Nudge Theory, find <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/ai-sales-forecasting/\">guided-selling intelligence</a> that proactively recommends actions that your sales reps should take.\n<h2><strong>Stages of Revenue Acceleration</strong></h2>\nIncorporating the components above, use the stages below to create a timeline for your revenue acceleration efforts.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Personalized Engagement:</strong></li>\n</ul>\nLive chatbots offer a constant stream of communication to the customer. Outdated CRMs limit the Marketing, customer service, and SDR teams to data silos. When data is presented in a clear, concise, and easy-to-digest format, making personalized connections with customers is that much easier. An adept way to do this is by adopting a system with nudges and insights that break down the data into bite-size pieces.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Expedite Deal Sequence:</strong></li>\n</ul>\nDeal insights and nudges can allow for the closure of deals sooner than anticipated. By assessing past and current data streams, AI engines are able to predict future wins and pick up on deals you might not have been considering for your current and next quarter pipeline. Having a platform that alerts you to these insights with a <a href=\"https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/nudge/\">nudge theory</a> based system can accelerate deal cycles.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Integrate On All Levels:</strong></li>\n</ul>\nAt the endpoint of any revenue acceleration revamp, the end goal should be full integration of those components previously mentioned. With optimized data retention and doing away with data silos, outdated CRM, spreadsheets, and other limited containment systems, you should already begin to see revenue acceleration occurring. Pairing with insights from <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/conversational-intelligence/\">conversational intelligence</a>, artificial intelligence and a platform that incorporates the methodology of Nudge Theory on all revenue acceleration teams (SDR, CS, marketing, etc.) will bring about the best results.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/revenue-forecasting/\">Best Revenue Forecasting Models</a></strong></p>\n\n<h2><strong>AI For Revenue Acceleration</strong></h2>\nIn Gartner’s Hype Cycle for CRM Sales Technologies, Aviso was mentioned as a sample vendor in the <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/sales-forecasting/\">predictive sales forecasting</a> tech space.

		"content": "Sales leaders of go to market (GTM) organizations are finding it tough to achieve their targets and are working hard to eliminate old practices and incorporate new ones. But, can sales leaders really make robust go to market strategies and compete in the market? In this article, discover 9 steps to future proof your go to market strategy. Read on to understand why these steps are important to remain in business.\n<h2><strong>What Is A Go To Market Strategy?</strong></h2>\nA GTM (go-to-market) strategy is a detailed and concrete action plan that describes how the marketing, sales, and customer success departments within a company will work together to launch either a new or existing product or service into the market.\n\nMost businesses struggle to forecast their <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/this-is-why-your-sales-forecasts-are-inaccurate/\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">sales accurately</span></a> and therefore miss targets. In fact, almost <a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.xactlycorp.com/resources/guides/how-accurate-sales-forecast-makes-you-hero-your-entire-company\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">80 percent</a> of organizations miss their forecast numbers by 25 percent or more. In order to future proof your GTM strategy and hit your revenue targets, we recommend specific and immediate actions.\n\nA GTM strategy brings its products or services to their target customers. It offers competitive advantage to businesses and takes into account different factors such as distribution and pricing. GTM strategy is mostly used when launching new products in an existing market, or existing products in a new market, or new products in a new market.\n<h2><strong>Benefits Of A Go To Market Strategy:</strong></h2>\nWhile a solid GTM plan offers numerous benefits to help and grow your business, we’re highlighting the main ones below:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Cuts down the time to market</li>\n \t<li>Ensures successful product launches</li>\n \t<li>Boosts ability to adapt to change</li>\n \t<li>Reduces costs linked to failed product launches</li>\n \t<li>Manages challenges related to product innovation</li>\n \t<li>Leads to better customer experiences</li>\n \t<li>Streamlines regulatory compliance</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Main Components Of A Go To Market Plan:</strong></h2>\nThe challenge today is that sales reps are no longer the primary product informers and educators for the buyers. That era has now gone. Buyers can easily look for all the required information online that can help them make decisions. They are expecting more, but seeing only limited value during their interaction with reps.\n\nThat's why it's critical that sales teams must have more expertise and knowledge than what the internet is already offering to buyers. Sales reps must show how their product adds value to the client’s business or how it improves their daily lives. Reps need to apply business-wide thinking while selling their products. Here are some of the main components of a go to market plan.\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Market:</b> Map out the market you want to sell your products and services to.</li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Customers:</b> Identify your target customers across your defined market.</li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Distribution:</b> Plan out how you will deliver your products and services to your customers.</li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Unique selling proposition (USP):</b> Identify the features or the perceived benefit in your offerings that make it unique from your competitors.</li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Pricing:</b> Set up the different pricing bands for your products or services that you want to offer to your customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>How To Create A Go To Market Strategy?</strong></h2>\nBusinesses must adjust themselves and become future proof to remain competitive. Follow these 9 steps to future proof your GTM strategy.\n<h3><strong>1. Define Your Target Market:</strong></h3>\nNo matter how good your product or service is, it isn't for everyone. Not every person has the problem that your business specializes in solving. It also isn’t cost-efficient to sell to every market available. Therefore, it is important to determine the correct audience in your go to market strategy. Determining the correct audience to target depends on such audience’s demographics, buyer habits and personas, and geographical location.\n\nFurthermore, your company must also list certain external markets to tap into. Although certain markets may not be aligned with your company’s niche or have similar attributes to your target audience, particular markets may still have accessibility and opportunities that should not be overlooked. Markets that are easy to reach, large in size, and small in competition are the best candidates for expansion.\n<h3><strong>2. Understand The Buyer Journey:</strong></h3>\nEvery buyer goes through a different process to make purchases. Therefore, businesses need to make the best effort to treat buyer’s as individuals. Even though your business likely cannot tailor their advertisements to each individual buyer, analyzing the journey can help attract the largest amount of customers.\n\nEach buyer goes through the awareness stage (realizing they have a need), the consideration stage (identifying potential solutions), and decision stage (choosing a specific product or service for the solution). By understanding this journey, your business can tailor their GTM plan around the most frequent stages.\n<h3><strong>3. Blend Your Sales, Marketing, and Operations:</strong></h3>\nThe core of a future proof sales org must contain unmatched efficiency of individual sales reps. Sales reps need lean processes in place along with operational and strategic tools to quicken up efficiencies. This helps them enhance their conversion rates across all the <a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/sales-pipeline-management/\">sales pipeline stages</a>. Also, all sales processes must be streamlined end-to-end from prospecting to closing.\n\nTo achieve this, the best performing sales orgs do not add more sales reps. They involve marketing and operations teams during the initial stages of the sales process, and use tools/technology to automate all their sales processes. This helps sales reps focus and spend more time on the actual consultation with clients.\n<h3><strong>4. Encourage Customer Engagement:</strong></h3>\nHow will you know what clients and customers need without asking? Customer engagement is key in GTM strategies as your company can get a feel on what needs and wants can be tended to. This process starts by companies researching into what issues their market is dealing with that their product or service can solve.\n\nConducting this research will then allow your company to translate into how your product or service can provide value in such situations. This can be done through testing products/services in the field, or interacting with customers through social media.\n<h3><strong>5. Strengthen Advertisements:</strong></h3>\nOnce your team has done thorough research into what customers are seeking, it is then time to tailor advertisements to the general needs of that market. This process not only includes generating content around those conflicts discovered, but also involves determining the best platforms to use. Different methods of advertising will provide different results, so it is important to determine which platforms will provide the best return on advertising investment.\n<h3><strong>6. Content Marketing To Attract Specific Leads:</strong></h3>\nIt is far easier to attract leads that already have knowledge about what business you are into, because those leads probably have subconscious interest in solving the issues your product or service can cover. Therefore, content marketing will help gain traffic to your websites or social media pages.\n\nThe primary action to content marketing is researching specific keywords that your leads tend to use. The goal of keyword research is to use certain phrases that are relevant to your market so when these leads use their search engine, your product or service will be at the top of their search results.\n\nOnce you have determined your keywords to use, it is then time to research for content that centers around those keywords and brainstorm topics to write about. Then, create and publish graphic designs, articles, and social media posts that will attract buyers to your website.\n<h3><strong>7. Create A Budget:</strong></h3>\nA go-to-market plan is going to require investments in order to make a return. This not only means operating expenses, but also determining the price of your product/service. Multiple factors should be considered when pricing a product. For example, your price should be compared to competitors’ price on their similar products in hopes that your company can gain a competitive advantage in that department. Also, the value of your product and perceived price expectations should be carefully considered as well.\n\nOperating expenses should be highlighted in your go to market strategy framework. Every element of your go to market plan, such as advertising, research, etc. should have established costs based on expected number of transactions, website traffic, and other factors.\n<h3><strong>8. Focus On Competitive Advantage:</strong></h3>\nFor your business to reach its maximum sales and <a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/revenue-forecasting/\">revenue potential</a>, your go to market model needs to consistently highlight competitive advantage, or in other words, what attributes can help your business stand out from other competitors.\n\nAll of the segments of your go to market template have potential to display a competitive advantage. Some of these include:\n\n<strong>Markets:</strong> Are we able to reach other markets our competitors can’t?\n<strong>Problem Solving:</strong> Can our product fix something that hasn’t been fixed?\n<strong>Design:</strong> What features of our product are the most difficult to duplicate?\n<strong>Finance:</strong> Can we determine a price better than other competitors?\n<strong>Advertising:</strong> Do we have a platform where we have the highest engagement?\n<h3><strong>9. Use The Power Of AI And ML:</strong></h3>\nNever underestimate the power of <a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/\">artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)</a> in sales forecasting, as these allow you to make many smart decisions. The combination of data, analytics, AI, and ML helps you improve sales forecasts significantly. AI in sales allows you to build predictive models that analyze disparate data sets that are generated during a sales cycle, and reveal insights that can impact a deal. On the other hand, ML algorithms enable your software to learn your data and improve over time.\n\nAI-powered tools can help you make <a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/sales-forecasting/\">sales forecasts</a> by product offerings, regions, and market segments. They can also track your historical data and offer real-time updates. ML-based solutions can effectively gather relevant data (such as buyer behavior, preferences, and dislikes) from CRMs, emails, and social media. AI and ML based software can guide your sales reps with the next steps for closing deals.\n<h2><strong>Go To Market Strategy Examples</strong></h2>\nHere are some of the great go to market plan examples:\n<h3><strong>1. Microsoft Surface:</strong></h3>\nDespite Microsoft Windows already dominating the computer industry, their go to market strategy framework for their own tablets was still effective. They sought to tackle the common issue tablet users face by marketing the Surface as a tablet that has the functionality of a computer. Their target demographic became college students and everyday users that would benefit from a lighter version of a computer.\n<h3><strong>2. Southwest Airlines:</strong></h3>\nWhen Southwest entered the airline industry in the 70’s they were in need of an established go to market model to advance their position in the market. They chose to do this by addressing the issue of connecting flights. Instead of using a “hub and spoke” system that airlines typically use, Southwest used a “point-to-point” system that allowed them to take passengers directly to their stop. Today, only 20% of Southwest passengers have to use connecting flights, one of many features that has made Southwest a preferred airline.\n<h3><strong>3. FitBit:</strong></h3>\nFitBit used a go to market plan to launch their SmartCoach service, which is a premium service and personal training app that connects to a consumer’s FitBit. Their campaign used paid and owned channels to reach their target market. They also used email marketing, social media, and push notifications to reach potential new customers. Their gtm strategy proved to be a success, as they accumulated about $192 million in revenue.\n<h3><strong>4. Vuclip:</strong></h3>\nVuclip, a mobile streaming service, is a prime example of a company that uses gtm planning because they do a solid job of analyzing the buyer’s journey, and then creating a competitive advantage out of it. Their service gained an appeal by becoming a must-have for global markets that struggled with streaming buffering issues. Instead of building for enterprise, they built their framework for the consumer, which resulted in 41 million customers across 3,000 cities worldwide.\n\nMost of all, to future proof your go to market plan, you must position your business ahead of your competitors in a sustainable manner.

		"content": "<em>“The future belongs to those who prepare for it today” </em>- M.K. Gandhi\n\nThis phrase still holds true today, especially for revenue leaders, sales executives, and CXOs who are keen to drive favorable sales outcomes for their teams. Accurately forecasting their sales numbers quarter-on-quarter can be an invaluable tool in helping them achieve those outcomes. These outcomes are invariably linked to a company’s health and growth. Sales forecasting can indeed make or break a business.\n<h4><strong>What’s in this guide:</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n \t<li>What exactly is sales forecasting?</li>\n \t<li>Why is sales forecast important?</li>\n \t<li>Different approaches to sales forecasting</li>\n \t<li>Why does inaccurate forecasting hinder growth?</li>\n \t<li>Benefits of accurate sales forecast</li>\n \t<li>Best practices to maximize the accuracy of forecasts</li>\n \t<li>A buyer’s guide to sales forecasting software</li>\n</ul>\nBefore we deep-dive into sales prediction methods, best practices, and tools that can help you achieve high accuracy in your forecasts, let’s define what sales forecasting actually is.\n<h2><strong>What Is Sales Forecasting?</strong></h2>\nSales forecasting is the process of predicting how much revenue a company, team, or person will generate within a specific timeframe. This could be a week, month, quarter, or even a year. The ability to forecast sales (accurately) is pivotal in enabling a company’s leadership to future-proof its strategic vision and run its day-to-day operations effectively.\n<h2><strong>Why is Sales forecast important?</strong></h2>\nThe value of sales forecasts is twofold. One, if you’re able to identify that you’re going to achieve or even exceed your sales target for the given quarter/month it gives you the ability to hire more staff, purchase inventory ahead of time, and cut down on delays that your organization might otherwise encounter down the line. Two, if you run your forecast accurately and see that you might not hit your number, you can proactively execute remediation plans--you can find more leads, build more revenue out of certain accounts, etc-- knowing how you’re going to perform in a given period will have far-reaching benefits in your org across job functions.\n<h2><strong>How To Create Sales Forecasting Accurately?</strong></h2>\nThere are myriad ways to forecast sales, all of which are highly dependent on your business model. However, some common sales forecasting models/methods that broadly apply to most firms are:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Top-down Sales Forecasting:</strong></li>\nTop-down sales forecasting starts with identifying your total addressable market or TAM and estimating how much market share you’ll be able to capture. For example, If the size of the market your product competes in is $100 million, a company may estimate that they can win 5 percent of that market, making their sales forecast $5 million for the year.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_11343\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"464\"]<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-11343\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Top-down-sales-forecasting-539x300.jpg\" alt=\"Top down sales forecasting\" width=\"464\" height=\"300\" /> Top-Down Sales Forecasting[/caption]\n\n \t<li><strong>Bottom-up sales forecasting:</strong></li>\n\nBottom-up sales forecasting starts with sales projections from reps who report on what they think can close based on the opportunities they have lined up. One of the advantages to doing this is that the projection estimate is based on the deals already in the pipeline, but on the flip side, there are several factors due to which the deal might not close. Thus sales managers and reps should constantly stay on top of sales activity and customer engagement data to make sure they close all deals to achieve their forecasts.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_11344\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-11344\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bottom-up-sales-forecasting-264x300.jpg\" alt=\"Bottom-up sales forecasting\" width=\"300\" height=\"100\" /> Bottom-up Sales Forecasting[/caption]\n\n \t<li><strong>Qualitative sales forecasting:</strong></li>\n\nQualitative sales forecasts are subjective and bring human intuition and emotion into the equation. Business leaders use their long-term expertise and industry knowledge to make predictions about where sales for the quarter are headed. This is advantageous because it takes into account external events like global pandemics that could affect their sales numbers. But this could also prove unreliable because ultimately it is based on observation and gut feeling rather than real data.\n\n \t<li><strong>Quantitative sales forecasting:</strong></li>\n\nQuantitative forecasting is a statistical technique that uses historical sales data to calculate accurate forecasts. There are two types of <a href=\"https://www.chegg.com/homework-help/definitions/quantitative-forecasting-methods-31\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">quantitative forecasting</a> methods. The first method is the time-series forecasting model, which examines and parses through past data to predict what your sales number will be based on your current <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/sales-pipeline-management/\">sales pipeline</a>. The second method is a linear regression-based forecast model called an associative model.\n\nQuantitative models are preferred by enterprises since they are data-driven and are highly objective in nature. It is one of the best ways for organizations to have a realistic view of their forecast numbers and land as close to their projections as possible (usually within 2%)\n</ol>\n<h2><strong>Why Inaccurate Forecasting Hampers Growth?</strong></h2>\nFor most companies coming up with an accurate sales forecast is still a major challenge. Thanks to inaccurate and intuition-based forecasting methods, companies end up having poor visibility into their sales projections. According to <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-02-12-gartner-says-less-than-50--of-sales-leaders-and-selle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gartner’s</a> “State of Sales of Operations” report, over 50 percent of sales leaders polled said that they have little confidence in being able to forecast their sales accurately.\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11345\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/How-to-forecast-sales-accurately-428x300.jpg\" alt=\"How to forecast sales accurately\" width=\"428\" height=\"300\" />\nHaving an accurate sales forecast is critical because enterprises cannot afford to miss their forecasts, as a missed forecast could prove disastrous. For example, if an organization over forecasts and under-delivers, it could affect the company valuation in a negative way. whereas if the organization under-forecasts and over-delivers, which albeit a good thing, would not give orgs the necessary lead time to leave money on the table in terms of marketing plans, product launches, and hiring.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/accelerating-the-revenue-process/\">How To Accelerate Revenue Process</a></strong></p>\n\n<h2><strong>Benefits Of Accurate Sales Forecast:</strong></h2>\nTo drive our point home, here are some of the benefits that an accurate sales forecast brings to the table.\n<ul>\n \t<li>An accurate sales forecast allows companies to efficiently allocate resources for future growth and manage their cash flow.</li>\n \t<li>Sales forecasts help set benchmarks for future trends and allow leaders to course correct early. Revenue leaders can align sales quotas and revenue expectations and optimize for more wins.</li>\n \t<li>Conveys confidence to the board, and the management team that your business is supported by a reliable forecasting machine that will scale well in the future.</li>\n \t<li>Sales projections facilitate strategic planning and tell you how soon you will be ready for executing and implementing your plans.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Best Tips To Improve Sales Forecasting Accuracy:</strong></h2>\nThere are several factors like market volatility (think covid 19), flawed methodologies, and clunky tools (spreadsheets) that can contribute to inaccurate forecast results. Here are some tips that can help improve your forecast accuracy.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Automate:</strong></li>\n</ul>\nIf your CRM data entry process is manual, then chances are inaccuracies are going to creep in--considering accurate forecast results mainly rely on clean data. One tip would be to set up a checklist of guidelines for data entry (even though this doesn’t scale well in the long run). An even smarter move would be to <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/crm-automation/\">automate the whole CRM process</a>.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_11346\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"472\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-11346\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Automate-Sales-Forecasting.jpg\" alt=\"Automate Sales Forecasting\" width=\"472\" height=\"247\" /> Automate Sales Forecasting[/caption]\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Incentivize:</strong></li>\n</ul>\nIncentivizing sales reps and tying a small portion of their compensation to accurate number calling can be very effective.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Integrate your revenue teams and tool up:</strong></li>\n</ul>\nDeploy a tool that unifies all teams (Ops, Finance, Product) on one platform, rather than spreading each function across disparate software. With a single tool, you can better hone in on your sales forecast accuracy as well as cut down on data slippage, collaboration inefficiencies, and wasted budget.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Invest in coaching your sales reps:</strong></li>\n</ul>\nMake sure your reps are <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/sales-warrooms/\">coached for accuracy</a>, revenue leaders and managers should invest time and effort to help their people ramp up and hit their number as fast as possible. Building a high-accuracy forecast culture can help avoid over-hiring and attrition rates as well.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>AI/ML tools can help change the game:</strong></li>\n</ul>\nForecasting until recently has been about looking at past numbers and predicting future revenue based on your quota, what your reps are willing to commit, and what you know about their past performances. Competent AI/ML tools employ a time series sales forecasting method, which parses all your past sales data/activity to help you achieve as close as 98%+ accuracy with your forecasts.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/revenue-forecasting/\">Best Revenue Forecasting Techniques</a></strong></p>\n\n<h2><strong>How To Choose Your Sales Forecasting Software:</strong></h2>\nIf you were a revenue leader, would you rather implement the above recommendations from scratch yourself, or let a sales prediction software do the job for you? A dedicated forecasting platform can deliver surprisingly quick results, including:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Improve the efficiency with which sales reps approach deal forecast</li>\n \t<li>Offer predictive insights into the overall sales pipeline</li>\n \t<li>keep managers and leaders in the know about team performance</li>\n</ul>\nHere are some features you should look out for if you choose to evaluate a sales forecasting tool:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Capabilities to integrate, extract, and map from data sources:</strong></li>\n\nThe forecasts you receive are only as good as the data your software can access. Integration with your databases/lakes/CRMs allow your tools to have all the information they need without having to enter information manually.\n \t<li><strong>Collaboration:</strong></li>\nSales projection is a collaborative effort – internal team alignment is key. A sales forecasting tool should have a collaboration space where operations, strategy, and field team members can get together to focus on deal reviews and other important aspects of the forecast.\n \t<li><strong>Multiple views to forecast across markets, accounts, and product lines:</strong></li>\nThe software should allow for multiple views of a sales forecast (business units, product lines, markets, and so on) and be flexible enough to let you configure your own custom forecast view for any level of hierarchy.\n \t<li><strong>Implements a blend of forecasting techniques:</strong></li>\nA good sales forecasting tool should have a provision for multiple inputs, so it can solve for the best possible outcome. Intuition-based projections from sales leaders, bottom-up forecasts, and time series analysis should all be factored in for high forecast accuracies and predictability.\n \t<li><strong>Helps visualize your overall sales data:</strong></li>\nData visualization is key in letting salespeople do what they do best: sell. You don’t want your people on the front lines to be busy reading a table of numbers to figure where they are in meeting their quarterly quotas. Moreover, a tool with built-in dashboards, reports, and analytics can inform CROs of how their quarterly forecasts look like, measure and compare sales growth over time, and even manage sales territory assignments.\n</ol>\n<strong>In closing:</strong> even though sales projections are a bit of a crystal ball at times, they can give you a sense of direction on where your revenue is, and where you should be going. If you are willing to leverage the tools and implement best practices that align well with your overall business, then you are well on your way to bringing in predictable and reliable revenue.\n\nInterested to learn more about <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/ai-sales-forecasting/\">Aviso’s AI sales forecasting</a> capabilities?

Here's what we'll cover:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is Sales Pipeline Management?</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Importance of Sales Pipeline</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sales Pipeline Management Best Practices</span></li>\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI-Guided Sales Pipeline Management</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best Sales Pipeline Management Tool</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who Should Use the Sales Pipeline CRM?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is Sales Pipeline Management?</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A sales pipeline management system helps the sales managers identify open sales opportunities that are about to vanish, without losing attention from active deals. Thus, it helps resolve issues at each sales funnel stage and drive more revenue.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In simple terms, a sales pipeline management system provides a view of funnel stages that each lead goes through. As prospects move from being a new lead into a customer, the system shows you how many leads your sales reps are expected to close with respect to their sales target.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Importance of Sales Pipeline:</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sales pipeline provides you a complete visual representation of where your new leads are in the sales funnel stages, such as awareness (prospecting and lead qualification), interaction (demo meeting and follow-up calls), interest (proposal and negotiation), and action (deal finalization and close). It also recommends actions your sales reps should take to convert a lead into your customer.</span>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_11244\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"440\"]<img class=\"wp-image-11244 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FUNNEL-GRAPHIC-440x300.png\" alt=\"Importance of Sales Pipeline Management\" width=\"440\" height=\"300\" /> <strong>                             Sales Pipeline Management</strong>[/caption]\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The journey of a sales opportunity in your pipeline drive differs from lead to lead. It depends on their interest in your products and services, budget, urgency-level to buy, etc. At times, there could be leads who’ll skip a few funnel stages of the sales pipeline. For instance, if a lead already knows your product and is ready to buy, you can directly move the opportunity to the final stage of your sales pipeline.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sales Pipeline Management Best Practices</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the 10 best practices to manage your sales pipeline effectively:</span><b></b>\n\n<ol>\n \t<h3><li><strong>Follow up With Leads:</strong></li></h3>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will end up losing leads and associated revenue if your follow-up process isn't robust enough. Your reps should contact them at the right time and engage with them through demos, product content, etc. With a robust follow-up process, you'll build healthy pipelines and know exactly when to qualify or disqualify leads.</span><b></b>\n\n<h3><li><strong>Do Not Allow Your Pipeline To Rot:</strong></li></h3>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clean up your sales pipeline regularly to get <a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/sales-forecasting/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">accurate sales forecasts.</a> That's because sales forecasts use the funnel stage for each opportunity while predicting a win or loss. For example, consider you've sent a proposal of $5,000 to a lead a week ago, but you didn't receive any reply since then. Your sales forecast will count that lead as <a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/revenue-forecasting/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">potential revenue and your forecast</span></a> data will keep showing off by that amount. Such gaps will continue to grow until you remove the dead opportunities from your sales pipeline.</span><b></b>\n\n<h3><li><strong>Never Reduce Your Sales Pipeline:</strong></li></h3>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When an organization generates a lot of leads and sales reps complete all the targets, reps tend to become complacent. They stop prospecting and later face an empty pipeline with no opportunities to pursue. Hence, ensure that your reps continue to prospect regularly so that your sales pipeline grows continuously.</span><b></b>\n\n<h3><li><strong>Regularly Conduct Pipeline Reviews:</strong></li></h3>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increase the number of opportunities to automatically increase the flow of leads through your sales pipeline. Spend time with your reps to define the lead, opportunity, and conversion process. Once the team is clear on the process, the forecast can be easily tracked and scaled. This will also help conduct regular <a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/sales-pipeline-review/\">pipeline reviews</a>.</span><b></b>\n\n<h3><li><strong>Know Your Sales Metrics:</strong></li></h3>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sales involves a lot of numbers, and you can understand your pipeline drive only if you completely know your metrics. That's why sales leaders must always stay on top of these figures. They could be win rate, loss rate, sales cycle length, opportunities to close deals conversions, number of leads generated in a month, and a lot more. Check that you have accurate data inputted at every sales stages in CRM, as inaccurate data can hamper efficiency.</span><b></b>\n\n<h3><li><strong>Shorten Your Sales Cycle:</strong></li></h3>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have a shorter sales cycle, you can spend more time on selling to prospects. On the reverse, a longer sales cycle gives your prospects enough time to change their minds and seek an alternative. That's why you must schedule the next meeting exactly at the end of each meeting. Don’t force your prospects into long agreements, but push for a quick and clear timeline that works for all.</span><b></b>\n\n<h3><li><strong>Effectively Use Content for Sales Enablement:</strong></li></h3>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more content your sales reps have at their fingertips for </span><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/components-sales-enablement/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sales enablement</span></a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the easier it will be for them to sell in any situation. Sales enablement content can be in the form of whitepapers, blog posts, case studies, product sheets, roadmaps, and playbooks. As leads move up the pipeline, they have unique questions and reps need different content to close them.</span><b></b>\n\n<h3><li><strong>Train Your Reps on Pipeline Management:</strong></li></h3>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It's a known fact that sales teams with properly trained reps earn more revenue as compared to those without. Ensure that each rep understands your complete sales process. All the reps must know the exact thing to do at each funnel stage, and be able to adjust based on business size, industry, and changing market dynamics.</span><b></b>\n\n<h3><li><strong>Identify and Target the Right Prospects:</strong></li></h3>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sales reps often spend too much time chasing the wrong prospects who do not match your target persona. Such mismatched prospects clutter your sales pipeline and lead to wasted efforts. Hence, always nurture the right prospects rather than having a lot of meaningless conversations. A </span><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/discovery-call/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pre-call checklist</span></a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be very useful here.</span><b></b>\n\n<h3><li><strong>Use a Tool to Manage Your Pipeline:</strong></li></h3>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It's hard to track leads manually, especially when your pipeline is overflowing with leads. Plus, not all leads would be in the same funnel stage. An Excel spreadsheet can help only when you're a one or two-person team. When your sales business grows, you'll have to manage thousands of prospects over months or years. The best way to handle this situation is by deploying a sales pipeline management tool.</span>\n<h2><strong>AI-Guided Sales Pipeline Management</strong></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), can offer deeper insight into the health and potential of your sales pipeline. AI-based guidance offers a data-driven, objective option that helps sales teams maintain pipeline growth and boost revenue. This is especially helpful during unprecedented and turbulent times such as the Covid-19 pandemic.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s how AI-guided selling can help nurture your sales pipeline.</span>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_10988\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"571\"]<img class=\"wp-image-10988 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/StepsPastel-1-571x300.png\" alt=\"AI-Guided Pipeline Management\" width=\"571\" height=\"300\" /> <strong>                                         AI-Guided Pipeline Management</strong>[/caption]\n<h3><strong>Adaptation: Quickly Adapt to the Current Situation</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>Covid-19 Risk Indicators</b></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can AI guidance help you overcome obstacles of uncertainty? AI draws wisdom from deep learning of vast data sources to guide you on the right path to conquer even the most formidable of challenges.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without a precise understanding of the pandemic’s economic impact on the pipeline, teams can be led astray by their own predictions and evaluations. AI-guidance offers risk indicators that provide sales teams with a robust appraisal of how the pandemic is affecting their current pipeline drive on the deal level.</span>\n<h3><strong>Generation: Build a Robust Pipeline</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>Pipeline Planning</b></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sustained revenue is only possible when your pipeline strategy is long-term. By planning for the future, you can lay out a strategic pathway for your team to pursue and course-correct when necessary. AI can offer insight into potential future pipeline and helps teams determine an optimal mix of opportunities for success.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>Pipeline Building</b></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before sales teams can successfully build pipelines, they must first have a sufficient foundation. AI-guidance helps you identify if the next quarter will start with enough pipeline. Teams are notified when pipeline generation slows in specific regions or segments so they can respond as needed.</span>\n<h3><strong>Growth: Expand and Grow Your Pipeline with AI</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>Pipeline Health</b></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintain the health of your pipeline with periodic objective health check-ups. Advanced analytics provide a data-driven assessment as opposed to CRM self-reports. Teams can compare pipelines at the start of the quarter to new pipelines added to ending pipeline predictions, as well as compare human and AI forecast predictions to determine the source of discrepancies.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>Intelligence Reports</b></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI-based intelligence reports show the progress of your past, current, and future pipelines so that you can better understand your pipeline acceleration</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and evolution through the quarter and evaluate the quality of the current and future pipeline.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>Pipeline Nudges</b></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ai-based timely nudges provide sales teams with direct insight into deals at risk and what actions should be taken to advance on those deals.</span>\n<h2><strong>Best Sales Pipeline Management Tool</strong></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With sales pipelines becoming too big and complex, the days of tracking them manually are over. Even then, most companies struggle with their sales pipeline management as they cling to outdated tools that don’t offer the level of insight you’ll find in modern sales pipeline software.</span>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_11245\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"313\"]<img class=\"wp-image-11245 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Group-2-313x300.png\" alt=\"Sales Pipeline Management Tools\" width=\"313\" height=\"300\" /> <strong>Sales Pipeline Management Tools</strong>[/caption]\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you aren't using modern tools, you’re losing sales to your competitors.

		"content": "Most revenue and sales leaders spend a lot of time asking their team questions such as - are we achieving the revenue target this quarter? Or, should we increase our sales reps to meet goals? That's important because getting to know what will happen in future helps make informed decisions.\n\nRevenue forecasting helps resolve most of the questions. There are various revenue forecast methods that provide accurate projected revenues for upcoming months and quarters. These also provide insights that help you take necessary action towards constant growth.\n\n<strong>Here's what we'll cover in this article:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>What is Revenue Forecasting?</li>\n \t<li>Importance of Revenue Forecasting Models</li>\n \t<li>4 Revenue Forecasting Models for Accurate Predictions</li>\n \t<li>Revenue Forecasting Techniques</li>\n \t<li>AI-Assisted Revenue Forecasting</li>\n \t<li>Team Selling and Overlay Organizations</li>\n \t<li>How Aviso Helps in Your Revenue Forecasting?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>What Is Revenue Forecasting?</strong></h2>\nLet’s take a look at revenue forecasting, or the estimated projection of the amount generated by your overall business operations over a specific period of time.\n\nSo, revenue forecasting is the process of computing the revenue of your business, either monthly, quarterly or annually. For example, if you want to know the revenue your business will generate in the next month, a forecasted revenue will tell you the estimated numbers. It is not a guesswork. Forecasting the revenue is based on the existing state of your business as well as your historical performance.\n\n\nA revenue forecast involves looking at your entire business, rather than only activities and quotas executed by your sales team. Compared to a <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/sales-forecasting/\">sales forecasts</a>, revenue forecasts tend to be more holistic. \n<h2><strong>Importance Of Revenue Forecasting Models</strong></h2>\nForecast revenue is important for all businesses, as it helps strategize how quickly or how much you want to scale your business. However, it's also one of the most difficult things to estimate.\n\n<strong>Revenue forecasting models help us:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>View the future expansion of the business in terms of revenue and expenses.</li>\n \t<li>Make critical decisions related to the staffing and <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/revops/\">revenue operations</a> of the business.</li>\n \t<li>Move beyond personal guesswork towards quantitative analysis to be more accurate.</li>\n \t<li>Expand the business into new markets and set revenue goals for upcoming months.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>4 Revenue Forecasting Models For Accurate Predictions</strong></h2>\nRevenue forecasting models (or methods) for accurate revenue predictions can either be quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative methods rely on measurable data, while qualitative methods rely on unmeasurable data. Also, revenue forecasting models aren't foolproof as they consider historical performance while showing the road ahead. But, if done properly, forecasting is mostly reliable. Let’s understand the methods with the help of revenue forecasting examples.\n\nBelow we've explained four main types of revenue forecasting methods:<b></b>\n\n<b>1. Straight Line Forecast Method:</b>\n\nThis method requires only basic mathematics and hence very easy to put in place. It provides fair estimates of what to expect in your future financial growth. It considers your historical revenue growth rate to measure future growth.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_11312\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"480\"]<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-11312\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Straight-Line-Revenue-Forecasting-Method-480x300.png\" alt=\"Straight Line Revenue Forecasting Method\" width=\"480\" height=\"300\" /> <strong>                                  Straight Line Forecasting Method</strong>[/caption]\n\nFor instance, if your business grew by 10 percent in the last 3 years, then using this method you can assume a similar growth rate in the next 2-3 years.<b></b>\n\n<b>2. Moving Average Forecast Method:</b>\n\nA moving average calculates the average performance of a metric within shorter time periods, such as days, months, and quarters. It's not used for long time frames, such as years, as it develops too much lag. This method is mostly used to estimate revenues, sales growth, profits, and other similar financial metrics.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_11313\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"480\"]<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-11313\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Moving-Average-Revenue-Forecasting-Method-480x300.png\" alt=\"Moving Average Revenue Forecasting Method\" width=\"480\" height=\"300\" /> <strong>   Moving Average Forecasting Method</strong>[/caption]\n\nThis method is helpful to determine underlying patterns. A growing moving average shows an upward trend, while a declining moving average signifies a downward trend.<b></b>\n\n<b>3. Time Series Forecast Method:</b>\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/platform/\">time series</a> method helps identify patterns in existing data that may repeat in the future. It focuses on data-driven forecasting across different financial metrics. This method is useful in scenarios where performance is mostly steady, and external trends affect forecasts.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_11314\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"480\"]<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-11314\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Time-Series-Revenue-Forecasting-Method-480x300.png\" alt=\"Time Series Revenue Forecasting Method\" width=\"480\" height=\"300\" /> <strong>Time Series Forecasting Method</strong>[/caption]\n\nFor instance, this type of forecasting can use revenue growth from past months to update performance in the future months based on external trends.<b></b>\n\n<b>4. Linear Regression Forecast Method</b>\n\nLinear regression depicts the relationship between two or more data points on a graph. It makes a trend line showing the relationship between the variables. This method is quite easy for businesses that create revenue forecasts in Excel. The trend line in this method helps forecast future growth, supports efficient budgeting, and helps in better decisions.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_11315\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"480\"]<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-11315\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Linear-Regression-Revenue-Forecasting-Method-480x300.png\" alt=\"Linear Regression Revenue Forecasting Method\" width=\"480\" height=\"300\" /> <strong>Linear Regression Forecasting Method</strong>[/caption]\n\nFor instance, let's take sales and profits as two variables. If sales grow, then profits also increase, thus creating a linear regression depicting a positive correlation between the two variables. But if sales grow and profits reduce, it indicates challenges such as growing expenses.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/accelerating-the-revenue-process/\">How To Accelerate Revenue Process?</a></strong></p>\n\n<h2><strong>Revenue Forecasting Techniques</strong></h2>\nSuccessful businesses have shown that forecast accuracy is enhanced by using certain revenue forecasting tips and techniques. Here are three fundamental techniques that can enhance your revenue forecasts.<b></b>\n\n<b>1. Forecast for Each Product at the Right Level:</b>\n\nMost revenue forecasts consider the expected market growth rate along with current year sales. They also consider factors such as seasonality trends, number of products sold, and average selling price. But, some factors will always be more important than others, so they should be considered at a more granular level compared to others. For instance, the forecast of a fast-moving Product-A would always be different from that of a slow-moving Product-B.<b></b>\n\n<b>2. Evaluate Sales Channel Productivity:</b>\n\nRevenue forecasts should always coordinate with your sales resources. Always check with your sales reps on how much they can achieve, and how fast they can convert leads into customers. Especially in B2B markets, sales quota planning is critical to forecast revenue. That's because factors such as the number of prospective customers in the pipeline and closing rates are important for revenue projections.<b></b>\n\n<b>3. Cross Check Revenue Forecasts with Market Data:</b>\n\nRevenue leaders discuss a lot about how much revenue is required to cover all expenses while making significant profit. Such discussions should always be based on actual market data. Always do a top-down check of all revenue forecasts against the macro view of the market data.\n\nMost modern AI-assisted revenue forecasting tools take care of these tips and techniques for you. Below we’ll discuss what we mean by AI-assisted revenue predictions.\n<h3><strong>Revenue Forecast Formula</strong></h3>\nYou can derive the forecasted revenue by multiplying your product's average selling price (for upcoming periods) with the expected number of product units sold. You can then make a decision to announce the forecasted revenue numbers during your investor conferences and financial meetings.\n<h2><strong>AI-Assisted Revenue Forecasting</strong></h2>\nIncreasingly we are seeing companies wanting to have both a sales forecast and a revenue forecast. This is all nice to say, but the issue remains that more than 70% of all sales forecasts are wrong. To get around the problem of reps and managers not committing to early-stage deals, machine learning (ML) and <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/revenue-analytics/\">predictive revenue analytics</a> (part of Artificial Intelligence or AI) are increasingly being used as objective solutions to faulty forecasts.\n\nUsing revenue forecasting AI software to “score” deals has been around for more than three years, so there has been time to assess the impact on customers and to judge what are the more appropriate use cases.\n\nThere are two major components to predictive deal scoring:\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>Is this a good opportunity?</b> — Is this a good fit based on product or solution, experience in this type of account or size of deal?</li>\n \t<li><b>Will this close within the desired time range?</b> — A measure of deal management.</li>\n</ul>\nGoing back to the different components of the forecast process, we can use that same list of component parts of the sales forecast, but this time, we can show where AI can be used to replace judgement-driven adjustments with adjustments based on data and the historical record. Here, AI helps transform your sales forecast into one that can apply to your company as a whole.\n\n<strong>So the revenue forecast now looks like the following:</strong>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Committed deals where reps are confident to close;</li>\n \t<li>Judgement changes to forecast categories such as “commit”, “best case” or “worst case”;</li>\n \t<li>Computation of amount adjustment based on historical variation depending on proximity to the projected close date;</li>\n \t<li>Computation for “blue birds” — deals that are not currently in pipeline but will open and close within the quarter;</li>\n \t<li>Yield calculation used to compute “cats and dogs”, smaller deals that are not managed at the deal level.</li>\n</ol>\nThese numbers should also be broken out by product, support and services if the company in question has non-recurring revenue such as implementation services included in the opportunity amount.\n<h2><strong>Team Selling And Overlay Organizations</strong></h2>\n<b>Team selling</b> occurs where the opportunity amount is split by percentage across several or more individuals and may add to greater than 100%.\n\n<b>Overlay organizations</b> are those in which product specialists also own quota for their products or services within a larger opportunity.\n\nFor example, for global sales accounts, there could be several salespersons working on the account (say, in North America and EMEA). The opportunity amount is shared between these reps with potentially the share or split being greater than 100%. For a sales forecast driven by quota attainment, the shared amount is applied up until there is a common management level, at which point the forecast amount needs to be adjusted down to reflect only 100% of the amount. In this instance, the sales forecast serves a different purpose than a revenue forecast would.\n<h2><strong>How Aviso Helps in Your Revenue Forecast?</strong></h2>\nAviso’s approach to revenue forecasting is unique and comprehensive.

Yet, many sales teams and leaders still struggle to obtain sales forecasts that accurately reflect reality.

This means that the odds are that </span><em><a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/this-is-why-your-sales-forecasts-are-inaccurate/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you’re doing something wrong</span></a></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or could be doing more. Moreover, reps spent around 2.5 hours per week forecasting, while managers spent 1.5 hours. Think of all the wasted time and misguided decisions that could be avoided. Fret not, a quick read of this article can set you on the right path. </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three ways to boost your sales forecast accuracy</span></h2>\n&nbsp;\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.Identify sources of forecast inaccuracy.</span></h2>\n&nbsp;\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Common sources of inaccuracy include:</span></h3>\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-11173 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sources-of-forecast-inaccuracy-571x300.png\" alt=\"pie chart of sources of sales forecast inaccuracy\" width=\"571\" height=\"300\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subjectivity</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reliance on gut feelings from reps and managers can easily skew predictions from reality. Being influenced by personal feelings or opinions rather than accurately interpreting the data, is a drawback that comes from human nature and error. There are areas when subjectivity and intuition can be helpful to a sales rep but interpreting data points isn’t one of them.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time Spent</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned previously, on average <em>r</em></span><em><a href=\"https://www.xant.ai/5-sales-forecasting-strategies/#forecasting\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eps spend 2.5 hours per week and managers 1.5 hours on forecasts. </span></a></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is time spent on tedious data entry leading to inaccurate forecasts, resulting in what seems to be meaningless busywork. Allocating resources and time to the right activities is important to an efficient and effective organizational management design. It should go without saying that your team members could be more productive if their time was freed from crunching numbers on outdated systems and spreadsheets. </span>\n\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-11174 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/time-spent-2-571x300.png\" alt=\"time spent on forecasting stat\" width=\"571\" height=\"300\" />\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volatility</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sales landscape is constantly changing, just think of the past year and the unprecedented impacts that Covid-19 had on the market. It’s difficult to </span><em><a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/path-to-plan-covid-19/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">accurately predict</span></a></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> how these factors will affect your revenue stream. Software that incorporates machine learning and can analyze abundant points of data new and old quickly, is the best way to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">incorporate rapidly changing new changes into our predictive models.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Methodologies</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historical data is not always accurate (see above). Time-series forecasting, for example, that predicts future values based on past data, can only serve as a benchmark but does not take into account other factors. </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clunky Tools</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long story short, spreadsheets are not conducive to forecasting. Classic models of CRMs by themselves, are not cutting it anymore. As we evolve in our workspaces and with technology, our sales forecasting tools need to be able to keep up. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By first identifying these sources of sales forecast inaccuracy, you can then focus on addressing the ones that need immediate attention. </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Clean up your data.</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s be real: manual data entry sucks. Very few (if any) salespeople say that CRM data entry is their favorite part of the job. Here is where sources of sales forecast inaccuracy can easily slip in. This is a critical flaw because the first and foremost requirement for an accurate sales forecast is clean data. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For clean data you must: </span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create and enforce a standardized checklist of guidelines for data entry.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incentivize the results.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The smarter option to reduce the issue: </span><b>adopt automation</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-11175 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/automation-571x300.png\" alt=\"automation=time saved\" width=\"571\" height=\"300\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Modern sales tools come with automated data entry systems for a smoother, less taxing experience. Automatic data cleaning technology is available on the market today, typically powered by auto-machine learning algorithms that identify information that needs to be inputted in various go-to-market systems. Additional automation tool options include automated nudge systems, which can provide timely reminders and alerts to </span><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/new-product-update-nudges/\">“nudge”</a></em></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> users to take action toward deal progression.  Nudge Theory suggests that appropriately placed nudges can </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stimulate advantageous actions and help increase the efficiency of resource use.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Integrate your revenue teams.</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salespeople want to be selling. As such, keep time spent on forecasting to a minimum -- but make it as effective as possible.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to get effective and efficient forecasting: </span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Deploy a tool that unifies all teams</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Ops, Finance, Product) on one platform, rather than juggling multiple software. With a single tool, you can better hone in on your sales forecast accuracy as well as cut down on data slippage, collaboration inefficiencies, and wasted budget. Your salespeople will appreciate this as well. </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Consider getting an advanced sales analytics tool</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that can be customized for each position in the sales hierarchy, from reps to managers to CROs, in addition to offering an advanced deal and pipeline insight and coaching features for seamless collaboration.</span></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After auditing your current forecasting system, you should be able to find which step would be best to first go forward with.

In this short guide, we will discuss what RevOps is, why it’s such a big deal, and how you can get started.</em></span>\n<h2>The Growth of RevOps</h2>\nRevenue Operations, also known as RevOps, is on the rise. More and more businesses are understanding how department alignment can decrease costs and increase profit.\n\nAccording to <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #993366;\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://learn.leandata.com/the-leandata-ebook-library/state-of-revenue-operations-2019&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1621658643602000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0oLwfttw5dcRHjP8MQfygm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LeanData’s State of Revenue Operations</a></span>, there was a 55% increase in the adoption of RevOps from 2018 to 2019. In addition, the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #993366;\" href=\"https://www.clari.com/blog/the-rise-of-revenue-operations-infographic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">proportion of LinkedIn job titles containing “Revenue Operations” is growing</a>,</span> with VP of RevOps titles increasing by 300% over 18 months and Director of Revenue Operations titles surpassing Director of Sales Operations titles by 68%.\n\nSo what’s the hype about? Let's start off by defining RevOps.\n<h2>What is RevOps?</h2>\n<strong>Revenue operations</strong> (<strong>RevOps</strong>) is a business function that optimizes revenue growth by aligning sales, marketing, and customer success operations. RevOps serves to drive accountability across these different departments for a unified approach to revenue generation.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11148 \" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RevOps.png\" alt=\"Revenue operations (RevOps) infographic aligning marketing, sales, and customer success.\" width=\"433\" height=\"142\" />\n\nYou may be familiar with the traditional departments in a B2B organization -- Marketing Ops, Sales Ops, Customer Success Ops. Each department has its own operations team dedicated to streamlining the productivity of its members. The goals of each team are set by the head of each department.\n\nAs a result, each department often develops separate motivations and responsibilities and may use separate technologies or methods to reach their goals.\n\nAs you can imagine, this can easily lead to the forming of <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #993366;\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/silo-mentality.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">organ</a></span><span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #993366;\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/silo-mentality.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">izational</a></span><span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #993366;\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/silo-mentality.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> silos</a></span> -- a gateway for poor communication and a lack of cohesion, which in turn can create <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #993366;\" href=\"https://www.talend.com/resources/what-are-data-silos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">data silos</a></span> that stifle workflow, derail business processes, and damage customer experiences.\n\nTo prevent this, businesses have turned to a centralized revenue function that understands the workings of and bridges the gap between separate departments -- a function we now call Revenue Operations.\n<h2>Benefits of RevOps</h2>\nHubspot reports that public companies with revenue operations support saw <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #993366;\" href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/revenue-operations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">71% higher stock performance, grew 19% faster, and raised 15% more profit than companies without.</a></span>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11149 \" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/55.png\" alt=\"From 2018 to 2019, there was a 55% increase in adoption of revenue operations (revops).\" width=\"493\" height=\"259\" />\n\nWhen successfully implemented, a strong RevOps team can offer many benefits, including:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Addressing <a href=\"https://info.aviso.com/state-of-virtual-selling-2020\"><span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>tool sprawl</strong></span></a> for better productivity and communication between teams</li>\n \t<li>Sharing <strong><span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #993366;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/revenueteamroles/\">cross-departmental insights</a></span></strong> for better customer journey and client retention and expansion</li>\n \t<li>Facilitating <strong><span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #993366;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/accelerate-remote-selling-with-guided-collaboration/\">transparency</a> </span></strong>for faster strategic growth</li>\n</ul>\nRevOps can provide your company with a significant competitive advantage. However, it’s up to you to find the right revenue leader and qualified operations specialists to truly tap into the optimal alignment for your business.\n<h2>How to Get Started with RevOps</h2>\nSuccessful RevOps teams will carve out higher-efficiency, cost-saving workflows for all the departments they work with. To do so, teams need to invest in these three key steps:\n<h4><strong>1. ASSESS</strong></h4>\nConduct an audit to identify processes that need improvement. Where do the sources of misalignment occur? How can information be better shared internally? For example, if sales and customer success teams are using different tools to communicate with clients, vital information is likely slipping through the cracks. It will be essential for your team to identify these problem areas in order to find solutions.\n\n<em>Pro tip:</em> calculate expenditures on total resource use. This can reveal areas where your team can both cut costs and align more effectively.\n<h4><strong>2. ALIGN</strong></h4>\nAlign your organization with <a href=\"https://info.aviso.com/a-week-in-the-life-of-sales?__hstc=27879020.e7f239f0f0fe5d0331ebc6e2472eac3e.1592153922866.1605668829087.1605671119204.52&amp;__hssc=27879020.2.1605671119204&amp;__hsfp=264725493\"><span style=\"color: #993366;\">unified tech stacks</span></a>, training practices, and <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #993366;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/the-top-3-ways-ai-guided-forecasting-beats-spreadsheets/\">data systems</a></span> that match the needs of its users. Consider using AI-based tools to automate tasks like CRM data entry that team members typically find time-sucks.\n<h4><strong>3. ASSIGN</strong></h4>\nIdentify the key players needed and communicate your plan for growth. Set clear expectations for overarching missions, long-term goals, and immediate next-steps. Choose team leaders to hold others accountable. Ideally, each go-to-market team will have a RevOps project leader.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11150 \" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/steps.png\" alt=\"3 steps to successful revops infographic: assess, align, and assign.\" width=\"548\" height=\"214\" />\n\nThe RevOps framework above allows for you to hone in on how to establish better cohesion, unity, and efficiency within your business. When successfully executed, RevOps can transform the way your organization drives revenue to optimize your output.\n___\n\n<strong>ABOUT US:</strong>\n<a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/\"><span style=\"color: #993366;\">Aviso AI</span></a> is an all-in-one AI revenue compass that guides sales and go-to-market teams to close more deals, accelerate growth, and find their Revenue True North.

If your rep keeps on forgetting to qualify buyers, do they need to set up <span style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #993366; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/new-product-update-nudges/\">a nudge system</a></span> to keep them on track? If your rep is ignoring forecasts and going ahead with risky deals, what can you do to <span style=\"color: #800000;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a style=\"color: #800000; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/5-surprising-reasons-why-your-deals-arent-closing-and-what-to-do-instead/\">divert this energy</a></span>?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use this data to prepare for sales coaching meetings so that you aren’t wasting time asking questions that might lead to defensive answers or confusion on the part of your rep.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more you know beforehand, the better you can tailor the discussion, and the more productive your conversations will be.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Leverage Outside Resources </span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the world of sales is vast, it can be easy to get stuck in a sales-centered bubble. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a sales manager, you likely have access to a wealth of valuable resources, including connections to the marketing or customer relations departments. Leverage these connections to gain information and knowledge your reps will need to succeed. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some examples of resources you might reach out for:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Customer FAQs, to be included in a demo</strong></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Top customer or user complaints, to prep for objections</strong></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>A curated selection of customer stories, to send in follow-up emails</strong></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Listen to Your Team</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, sales coaching involves taking a step back. Encourage your reps to tell you what exactly they’re struggling with. This might be something that can’t be gleaned from the data, or may be a side effect of a larger issue.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, allowing your reps to disclose their concerns can help you better assess your reps’ strengths and weaknesses and better understand how to coach them. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, taking a step back can mean trusting your team to teach themselves. Schedule a meeting to ask them to share with one another what’s working and what’s not. Evidence shows that </span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #800000; text-decoration: underline;\"><a style=\"color: #800000; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"https://medium.com/bestcompany/experts-vs-friends-the-definitive-guide-to-who-influences-us-and-why-6a0aa609c8c0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we place a lot of value in the words of our peers</span></a></span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #800000; text-decoration: underline;\">,</span></span> and it might turn out that one of your reps learns better by listening to other reps in the field.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ask your top performers to speak about their successes and failures, and listen in on their stories. Encourage your low performers to speak as well -- they might have some surprising insights! </span>\n\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-11118\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/conv.png\" alt=\"Conversational intelligence, call transcriptions and recordings, and other data to use in your sales coaching analysis.

With a little bit of preparation, discovery calls can be simple and straightforward.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below, I’ve listed an essential roadmap with the 3 steps to follow in order to streamline your discovery calls, including a pre-call checklist and examples of discovery call questions. Let’s get started!</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #bf416d;\"><strong>The 3 Steps to Execute a Rock-solid Discovery Call</strong></span></h2>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #993366;\">Step 1. Research your prospect.</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Preparing for your discovery call is half the battle. Each prospect is unique, and it’s important to tailor your approach to each client in order to best optimize your upcoming conversation.</span>\n\n<b>Start by setting out 10-15 minutes to scope out your lead. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, you’ll want to identify a “hook” -- a point of common interest or connection that hits the three Rs: </span><span style=\"color: #bf416d;\"><a style=\"color: #bf416d;\" href=\"https://www.sellingfromtheheart.net/blog/sales-professionals-are-real-relatable-relevant-with-their-clients-are-you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Real, Relatable, and Relevant</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></a></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you share a love for travel or a mutual friend, your aim should be to establish an authentic connection built on trust. More than anything, your prospect wants to know they can rely on you to deliver on your promises.</span>\n\n<b>Tap into the wealth of information available on the Internet</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. A quick search on Google, LinkedIn or Twitter can provide a lot of insight into your prospect’s personal values and interests.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Likewise, make sure to skim through their company’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About Us</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> page, PR, blog articles, and associated social media to get a sense of the company’s organizational structure and overarching goals.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a look into your CRM and </span><span style=\"color: #bf416d;\"><a style=\"color: #bf416d;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/crm-automation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">customer reporting tools</span></a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to see what information is already available. Review any previous interactions you might have had with your lead, such as emails or recorded conversations.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep your eyes peeled for red flags that might disqualify your prospect. Recognizing that your lead is not a good fit is equally important and can save you valuable time and effort.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are several pre-call questions to answer as you conduct your research:</span>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11034\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pre-Call-Checklist-1.jpg\" alt=\"Sample discovery call prep checklist. Jennifer Wang.\" width=\"604\" height=\"556\" />\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #993366;\">Step 2. Plan out your discovery strategy.</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use what you learned in your 10-minute research session to help you to create an effective outline for your conversation.</span>\n\n<b>The next step is to structure a discovery call agenda. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go into the discovery call with a clear vision of what you’re hoping to accomplish within the timeframe of the call and lay out a path with talking points and questions that will help you achieve this goal.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can tailor this structure to fit your needs and your client. Using a discovery call agenda, you can develop a script for each section and customize it to fit your own style.</span>\n\n<img class=\"alignright wp-image-11036\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Group-1248-1.jpg\" alt=\"Five-point discovery call model. Image courtesy of Aviso design team.\" width=\"291\" height=\"277\" />\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A typical discovery call will follow this basic structure:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Introductions</span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expectations</span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discovery</span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solution</span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next steps</span></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s walk through each of these sections individually.</span>\n\n<b>Start with introductions</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The first few minutes of your discovery call are crucial. In this section, your goal is to build rapport and set the tone.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Introduce yourself, your company, your role, and your solution’s </span><span style=\"color: #bf416d;\"><a style=\"color: #bf416d;\" href=\"https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/04/27/value-proposition-examples\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">value proposition</span></a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 20-30 seconds. Here’s where you can also use your “hook” to establish your connection with the prospect and to reassure them that you are trustworthy, reliable, and worth their time.</span>\n\n<b>Set expectations</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Manage expectations by explaining to the prospect how you intend for the discovery call to unfold. You want for the prospect to understand that this initial meeting is for you to learn about the prospect and their needs.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some best practices include:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sharing your objectives for the meeting</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outlining several main points</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Touching on future actions (e.g., “I’ll follow up with an email after our discussion today.”)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<b>Dive into discovery. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s time to dive into the heart of the matter: learning about your prospect’s needs and goals. Prepare a general list of questions that focus on qualifying/disqualifying the buyer. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t know where to begin? Here’s a sample checklist of discovery call questions:</span>\n<ol>\n \t<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tell me about your company. </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are some of the main responsibilities of your role?</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What projects are you currently working on? What is your goal for these projects?</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How does it impact you or your company if you are unable to reach this goal?</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you have an assigned budget for this project? </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you made similar purchases in the past?</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are some challenges you’re facing?</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How are you handling these challenges?</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do you see our solution fitting in your process?</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What options are you considering?</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ll want to pay close attention to your prospect's tone of voice and what they say, and consider what this might mean for the deal. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, if your prospect tells you that a higher-up is responsible for the budget, </span><span style=\"color: #bf416d;\"><a style=\"color: #bf416d;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/5-surprising-reasons-why-your-deals-arent-closing-and-what-to-do-instead/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you might be speaking to the wrong person</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></span>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11037\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Talk-Duration-1.jpg\" alt=\"Discovery call talk duration. Image courtesy of Aviso product and design team.\" width=\"363\" height=\"200\" />\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember also that a discovery call should be a two-way dialogue. As a rule of thumb, <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/conversational-intelligence/\"><span style=\"color: #c7344a;\">a good talk-to-listen ratio is 50:50</span></a>. Don’t just </span>grill your prospect <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with a never-ending list of questions!</span>\n\n<b>Share your solution</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. After you’ve qualified your lead and are satisfied with the information you’ve acquired, you can move on to discussing your solution.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many discovery calls will include a soft sell-- a low-pressure explanation of your product or service, often accompanied by FAQs, objections, and customer case studies. </span><span style=\"color: #bf416d;\"><a style=\"color: #bf416d;\" href=\"https://larrygmaguire.com/hard-selling/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s why a hard sell doesn’t work.</span></a></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most importantly, you should touch on the needs and pain points of your prospect. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why should they care about your product or service? </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Align your solution with a challenge they mentioned earlier in the conversation. Address any potential objections and share success stories from clients similar to your prospect.</span>\n\n<b>Proceed with next-steps. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wrap up your discovery call with a shared understanding of what will happen next.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leave off future actions for a second interaction. Depending on the information you’ve gained, you might want to schedule a second call to conduct a demo or discuss personalized pricing. If you find that your prospect is not a good fit for your business, you could let them know that you’ll reach out with a follow-up email later.</span>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11038\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Modal-Next-Steps-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"Notification example for discovery call next steps. Image courtesy of Aviso product and design team.\" width=\"371\" height=\"262\" />\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #993366;\">Step 3. Keep an open mind.</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Congrats! You’ve done your research, filled out your agenda, and now you’re geared up to nail the discovery call. Finally, it’s time to meet your prospect.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key to success here is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">flexibility</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Go with the flow -- it’s okay to break script and ask questions you feel are relevant to the discovery call.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some tips for an effective conversation:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Ask open-ended questions</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Leave room for your prospect to expand on their answers. If they’re giving one-word replies, prompt them with a statement such as “Tell me about ___.”</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Listen and empathize</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. People like to be heard. Pay attention to what your prospect says, validate their emotions, and offer up your own thoughts in response. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Ask for feedback</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It’s good practice to ask your prospect how they feel about the conversation and if they have any questions. Here's your chance to clear up any lingering confusion or misunderstandings.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Keep an open mind</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Sometimes, after all of your preparation, things don’t go as planned -- and that’s alright! You’ll leave the conversation having learned from the experience.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Leave a positive impression</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As you conclude your discovery call, remind your prospect of the benefits of your solution. Let the prospect know that you enjoyed the conversation and that you’re eager to work with them again.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11039\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Conversational-Intelligence_Sentiment-1181x600.jpg\" alt=\"Sentiment analysis for each speaker of the discovery call.

		"title": "How AI Will Guide Corporations [Part 1: Redefining Roles]",
		"image": "https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Blog_AmitForbes_Pt1.png",
		"content": "Industries dramatically change every decade or so. Consider this—<a href=\"https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/only-52-us-companies-have-been-on-the-fortune-500-since-1955-thanks-to-the-creative-destruction-that-fuels-economic-prosperity/\">only about 50 companies</a>, or roughly 10%, have remained on the Fortune 500 list since 1955. As we start moving into the early 2020s, we’re on the cusp of another major change, one that will be guided by artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAs revenues rise and fall, and companies adjust to new economic, political and social landscapes, the internal workings of companies change as well—specifically, executive roles, processes and technology. For the first article in my three-part series, I’ll walk you through how, guided by AI, executive roles within companies will change in the 2020s.\n\nCompanies have long assigned new responsibilities to some executive roles, and have carved out new executive roles, too. For instance, these days, it’s not surprising to see a company with a chief revenue officer (CRO) <a href=\"https://medium.com/demand-karma/chief-revenue-officers-why-they-are-replacing-cmos-c0db851d6058\">either operating alongside or in place</a> of a chief marketing officer (CMO). It’s also becoming increasingly commonplace for chief information officers (CIOs) to <a href=\"https://www.reworked.co/employee-experience/how-the-cio-and-chro-will-rethink-employee-experience-together/\">work more closely</a> with chief human resources officers (CHROs) to improve the employee experience.\n<h4>Why AI Will Reshape Go-To-Market Executive Roles The Most</h4>\nIn the 2020s, changes to executive roles in go-to-market departments—finance, marketing, customer success, sales, product development and human resources—will be guided by AI. This is a crucial development in the evolution of the corporation because it will also inform how practitioner and staff roles evolve in the 2020s.\n\nRoles in these go-to-market departments have the most potential to be redefined by AI because they naturally rely on a lot of data and shifting variables. These roles are marked by conditions of <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/how-to-use-ai-to-boost-business-confidence-in-a-vuca-world/\">VUCA</a>, which stands for volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. People have to make decisions in these roles that are, on some level, predictive.\n\nWhile each unique role will be redefined and retooled through automation and augmentation via AI in different ways, broadly, AI can guide executives and other employees in these departments by showing them what’s going on across the business (the big picture view), by presenting them with different scenarios and associated consequences and by suggesting fresh ideas.\n\nFor instance, CMOs traditionally make marketing decisions based on past campaign data, such as lead conversion rates. AI could give them another layer of guidance to show them different scenarios and options and the good and bad that could result from each decision, such as selecting a new segment, targeting a new geographical market or starting a new brand campaign. AI could even show CMOs novel ideas they might not have brainstormed on their own.\n\nWe’ll also see chief customer officer (CCO) and chief experience officer (CXO) roles be drastically redefined, if not enabled, by AI. People in these roles interface with customers at various stages of the customer journey. AI will augment their decision-making to streamline and improve those customer interactions. We are living in a buying era where <a href=\"https://go.forrester.com/blogs/three-myths-of-the-67-percent-statistic/\">67%</a> of the buyer’s journey happens digitally. Unlike the classic funnel of awareness-consideration-purchase, buyers are acting non-linearly. They ask LinkedIn connections for recommendations, research competitors, use free trials and more. Using AI to collect data points along the customer journey, CCOs and CXOs can engage customers at the right time, on the right channel, with the right message.\n<h4>How AI Will Reshape Roles Outside Of Go-To-Market Executive Roles</h4>\nOutside of the executive suite, one example of AI retooling these go-to-market departments that we’re already seeing is in the news industry. Using algorithms and live data, Reuters writes <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonchandler/2020/02/07/reuters-uses-ai-to-prototype-first-ever-automated-video-reports/?sh=b0fe8787a2a7\">text-based summaries</a> of some sports games. Reuters also <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonchandler/2020/02/07/reuters-uses-ai-to-prototype-first-ever-automated-video-reports/?sh=b0fe8787a2a7\">introduced a prototype</a> for a fully automated presenter-led sports news summary system earlier in 2020. This ties into something important I think will happen. It’s not that AI will necessarily replace many jobs (although it will replace some); it’s more so that AI will enhance the more “chore-like” aspects of these roles, freeing up people to produce more and use more of their energy to create and innovate.\n\nApart from the go-to-market departments, roles in development, IT and other technical areas may also be augmented by AI. Consider this—in the past, data scientists spent a huge percentage of their time on model selection, or identifying the right machine learning models for problems. Now, with auto machine learning via platforms like AWS and Microsoft, AI can choose the right models with minimal data scientist involvement.\n<h4>The Possibility Of A Chief AI Officer At Every Company</h4>\nIn short, executive roles in go-to-market departments will reap many benefits from AI, as will their teams. With these data-driven predictions at their fingertips, they’ll be able to make more nuanced, educated decisions and spend less time reaching those decisions, gaining a competitive advantage in the process.\n\nGoing a step further, we’re already starting to see people in chief AI officer (CAIO) roles. Maybe every company in the future will have a CAIO who oversees the role of AI in the organization. Or, maybe chief digital officer (CDO) roles will incorporate more AI responsibilities, developing ethical frameworks for how their companies use AI internally and externally. Perhaps companies will even have an AI robot or two on their board of directors, something a Hong Kong-based VC firm has <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Artificial-intelligence-gets-a-seat-in-the-boardroom\">already done</a>.\n\nWhen it comes to reshaping jobs, AI won’t be the be-all, end-all. It’ll be more like a team member “hired” to help people in different roles. Think about all the administrative, repetitive parts of your job that you’d love for an AI assistant to take care of! AI won’t stop at transforming roles, either. In my next two articles, I’ll explain how AI will guide changes in the processes and technologies companies use.",

		"image": "https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/5-Mistakes-Header.png",
		"content": "Closing deals is no small feat; even sales superstars will admit how challenging the journey can be to transform a prospect to a customer. Sometimes, your best efforts to secure an agreement may be met with rejection -- or even worse, devastating silence.\n\nWhat went wrong? Of course, each process of closing a deal is unique, but successful salespeople are always looking out for ways to make their sales strategy more effective. Below, we suggest several not-so-common mistakes sales reps might be making and outline exactly how you can patch up these weaknesses to transform lukewarm leads into secured wins.\n\nHere are 5 unexpected reasons why your sales deals aren’t closing the way you’re expecting, and just how to fix them.\n<h4>Reason #1: Using outdated sales techniques.</h4>\nYou may have been taught a certain way to sell, or maybe you have a particular set of time-tested strategies. Though these might have worked in the past, customers are becoming more and more perceptive and may be resistant to older, more popularly-used tactics. When you hit a wall -- perhaps a tricky client or a stubborn deal -- it may be time to experiment with something new.\n\nOne way is to take advantage of the wealth of information on the Internet and tap into social media. It’s where the majority of users spend <a href=\"https://review42.com/how-much-time-do-people-spend-on-social-media/#:~:text=The%20average%20US%20adult%20spends,was%20142%20minutes%20a%20day.\">almost 20% of their waking hours</a>, and a lot of insight can be gleaned from a quick dive into a LinkedIn profile. Turn your cold calls into warm ones by researching prospects, developing a compelling reason behind your initial call, and offering up unique insights from the get-go; you might find that clients will be much more willing to continue the conversation.\n\nIn addition, don’t be afraid to try out automation. A plethora of software exists to help make your job (and your life) much easier. For instance, automated meeting-booking allows for clients to choose to meet with you at their leisure. Some programs can even <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/conversational-intelligence/\">transcribe and analyze your sales conversations</a> so you can get a more objective understanding on your client and overall progress.\n<h4>Reason #2: Talking to the wrong person.</h4>\nEveryone knows that lead quality matters; it’s nearly impossible to close a deal with someone who’s just not interested. In order to identify high-quality leads, the salesperson must first ensure that prospects\n<ol>\n \t<li>Have a need and a desire to solve that need, and</li>\n \t<li>Have the resources and power to do so.</li>\n</ol>\nIn other words, close with the <strong>right people</strong>. Sometimes, your prospect is handed down to you by a manager, but can only act as an intermediary or recommend you to a higher-up. Instead, aim to speak with the main decision-makers: the actual stakeholders with the power and money to make the purchase. Your time is valuable; spend it on people who can deliver.\n<h4>Reason #3: Lack of balance between building relationships with the buyer and qualifying them.</h4>\nTrust is one of the main predictors of customer loyalty and repeat purchase, yet building relationships with clients is often one of the most difficult aspects of selling.\n\nHow do you create trust? Identify your client’s principles and appeal to these values. Build a system of mutual respect by genuinely listening to your client. You might find that you’ll learn a lot more and that your client will be more satisfied with your interactions, which directly translates into successful sales closures.\n\nAt the same time, keep in mind that you need to be hitting certain checkpoints in the sales process. Quantify your customer conversations according to your timeline and delineate the next steps you need to take in order to move the conversation forward. Go into your conversations with certain goals in mind, but remember that your priority is to cultivate trust.\n<h4>Reason #4: Not solving your buyer’s needs.</h4>\nAs a salesperson, it’s your responsibility to delve into buyer pain points and desires and align these emotional motivators with what you have to offer.\n\nInstead of simply listing product features, tap into your inner storyteller. Pitch the buyer as the hero of their own story, and your product as the perfect solution to help them overcome a significant obstacle:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Identify (and confirm) your buyer’s functional and emotional needs.</strong> What are some personal reasons the buyer would benefit from the purchase?</li>\n \t<li><strong>Show your buyer exactly why your product solves their needs.</strong> A new mattress would improve sleep, health, and overall mood so that you can greet the next day with energy and finally get to those side projects you’ve been putting off.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Build up additional value by differentiating your product.</strong> Emphasize additional benefits and provide evidence of previous success.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Set them up for success. </strong>Understand your client’s bottom line and what criteria is needed for them to go through with the decision. Ensure that the transition to your product is painless by providing them with sufficient resources.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Reason #5: Being over-optimistic about the deal and/or your own abilities.</h4>\nThe first step to success is to learn. Successful salespeople understand that the sales landscape is always changing, and as a result, are flexible to adaptation and constantly seeking opportunities for self-improvement. Getting a second pair of eyes can be incredibly helpful when you hit a roadblock. You might learn something new by asking your manager to witness a call or a teammate to look over your emails.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10412\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/5-sales.png\" alt=\"5 reasons why your deals aren't closing infographic.

When you run into an inevitable obstacle, having resilience, flexibility, and the willingness to try new things can help you develop a new strategy of action and, in the long term, set you up for success.",

		"image": "https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TT-Rocket-Science-Blog-Header-1.png",
		"content": "As a game theorist and mathematician by training and CEO of a disruptive AI startup, I’ve always been fascinated by the parallels between company building and launching rockets. Often folks casually throw around this phrase for a lot of things - \"it's not rocket science.\" I’ve always found that phrase a bit odd because there are so many aspects of successful space launches that can directly help technology startups scale into bold new frontiers.\n\nElon Musk and SpaceX have shown this by literally scaling a space startup into commercial viability. In 2008, SpaceX became the first private company to launch a liquid-fueled rocket into orbit, and just 10 years later, they successfully deployed CEO Elon Musk’s red Tesla roadster (driven by “Starman,” a mannequin in a spacesuit) into space and set it on course to orbit the sun.\n\nYet, SpaceX has also experienced major failures and setbacks, including three failed attempts to launch a rocket into orbit in 2006, 2007, and 2008. SpaceX has experienced the full range of successes and failures that define the startup journey, and they did it right before our eyes in the most visible setting possible.\n\nRegardless of what your company does, and whether you are the CEO, CTO, hardware or software AI engineer building the future, you, too, will have to navigate the ups and downs that are part of being a startup.\n\nIn this post, I cover the three critical steps you must take to get your startup off the ground, into orbit, and safely to your destination. Imagine a space station out there in the Milky Way, serene and calm from the outside, while moving at Mach 26. (A bullet moves at less than Mach 1.) Wouldn’t you like your startup to get there too?\n<h3><strong>Step 1: Create Escape Velocity</strong></h3>\nSpace itself isn’t as difficult to navigate. You just take off and go straight up and gravity is perhaps 1-2% less and it feels like molasses in the upper atmosphere. The real issue is escape velocity.\n\nTo successfully launch a rocket, you must achieve radical outward acceleration equal to the inward acceleration of gravity to reach net-zero gravity. Radical outward acceleration requires propulsion, and propulsion requires fuel — massive amounts of it. Your startup’s escape velocity is fueled by your first customers and key initial hires.\n\nThose first customers give you the cash and momentum needed to get your company off the ground. Your initial deals will also build confidence and credibility you’ll need to make those first few hires, who will be critical to company building.\n\nThe people you hire first are just as important as those first customers. They will help you execute and successfully deliver unmatched value to your customers, building on the relationships you’ve already developed and setting the table for more work.\n\nBeyond adding scale, your first hires should bring new skills to the organization to complement your skillset and increase the company’s capabilities. There’s just no substitute for nailing it in these first two moves. To achieve lift-off, you’ll have to land those first few deals and make great hires to help you start strong.\n<h3><strong>Step 2: Stabilize in a Parabolic Arc</strong></h3>\nOnce off the ground, you need to continue going up (growing), but in a more horizontal and stabilized trajectory until you reach orbit and deliver the payload, which could be a satellite, or in your case, products. You want to stabilize at Mach 10, in a coin funnel shape, and sustain a parabolic arc through consistent growth and expanding market share.\n\nThis is where your initial hires will prove themselves. Stability is a function of infrastructure and processes, and your core team should be building out both as they hire staff and drive execution. It is important to develop both soft and hard Infrastructure (right tools, right culture) around key functions such as pipeline and demand generation, customer development, project management, to stabilize your company as it grows.\n\nEstablishing a healthy trajectory is truly an exercise in competing priorities. On one hand, you have to keep growing and gaining market share and new customers. On the other, you have to continue delivering value to retain those initial customers who gave you the escape velocity you needed to launch. This requires talented managers. With your leadership, your core hires will be the ones to maintain the balance necessary to stay the course.\n\nHowever, there is no friction in space so how do you get to where you want to be, while keeping the company intact? You can add strategic funding or deals that act as nitrogen boosters. This can help you get a push to hypersonic.\n<h3><strong>Step 3: Survive the Trip Home</strong></h3>\nIf your company can reach escape velocity and stabilize growth for long enough, you will scale and eventually approach commercial viability. You can then use fins, e.g. add larger funding rounds, or bigger deals, to guide your company through hypersonic, supersonic, subsonic, transonic, levels with precision and detail to land at an exact spot in an island in the great oceans.\n\nWhile continued growth remains important, the emphasis now shifts further toward stability in the form of capital. You must secure strategic financing and land big, longer-term deals to reduce volatility and ensure continued growth over a longer period of time. At this point, your company is essentially growing out of the startup phase.\n\nFor a founder, this step is akin to the reusable portion of SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy Rocket re-entering the atmosphere after deploying Elon’s roadster. The objective is complete, and much like the Tesla, your company is on rails toward the goal. Now you can now focus on returning home. If you miss and you are in the ocean, and you lose everything including your payload. Even Elon Musk missed several times.\n\nIf you do it right, you will safely land in a precise location back on earth. If you miss, you could lose everything — and this is the risk that building a company, team, and successful journey requires.\n<h3><strong>Putting It All Together</strong></h3>\nYou could even say that building a startup has the same probability as building a rocket and landing it with boosters on a small island in the Pacific Ocean. Building a team, company, and category and exiting successfully is indeed rocket science and we can learn a lot from what the space startups are doing.\n\nIf you do it right on every front, you are a God. If you do it right on some fronts, you can keep trying over and over, working the science. If you don’t even try you will be on your rocking chair at 80 and wondering why you did not try. So adopt the Regret Minimization Framework as Jeff Bezos did and start sketching your trajectory today.\n\nP.S.

		"title": "This Is Why Your Sales Forecasts Are Inaccurate",
		"image": "https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Group-48-1.png",
		"content": "Regardless of if you’re a startup looking to scale or an industry leading corporation, sales forecasting is essential for the growth and success of any business. At the very forefront, a sales forecast paints your company’s financial story. By giving sales reps a glimpse into future revenue levels based on consumer demands and trends, your forecasting can better guide short-term and long-term goals and performance. While sales forecasting methodology varies from business to business, an accurate forecast provides sales teams and leaders a clear plan for growth.\n<h3><strong>Why Is Sales Forecasting Important? </strong></h3>\nAn accurate sales forecast helps drive wiser business decisions around setting goals, budgeting, and other revenue-impacting factors. Beyond that, forecasts have the power to influence current and future deals in the sales pipeline from beginning to end. An affective forecasting model also allows sales teams to identify potential blockers and course-correct when trending off target.\n\nHere’s how an accurate sales forecast can help each level of the sales hierarchy:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Helps give confidence to upper management, including the CRO and CFO, about business and revenue continuity</li>\n \t<li>Is fundamental for sales reps and client-facing teams to set measurable and attainable goals</li>\n \t<li>Helps managers set realistic quotas and maintain expectations from sales reps</li>\n</ul>\nHowever, accurately predicting sales forecastas is not always a clear-cut process. <a href=\"https://www.xant.ai/blog/sales-forecasting-research/\">According to Xant</a>, only 28.1% of forecasts are actually close to being accurate. That means that a whopping 71.9% of sales forecasts are inaccurate. With all that being said, sales forecasts don’t have to be perfect to be valuable, but overly inaccurate forecasts are problematic and can lead to poor business decisions.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10248\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Group-47.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1949\" height=\"1183\" />\n<h3><strong>Why Most Sales Forecasts Are Inaccurate:</strong></h3>\n&nbsp;\n<h4>1. Poor CRM Data</h4>\nCRM software is widely used by sales teams to store consumer prospect information, track customer interactions, and better manage their relationships. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Editorial/Magazine-Features/Tips-for-Maximizing-CRM-Investments-117856.aspx\">91%</a> of companies currently have a CRM system in place. However, one of the biggest barriers to CRM effectiveness, as well as a driving factor to inaccurate forecasts, is bad data.\n\nRoot causes of poor CRM data ranges from duplicate data and invalid contact information to inconsistent records and data decay. <a href=\"https://www.introhive.com/resources/3-biggest-barriers-that-impact-your-crm-success-with-david-whiteside/\">According to Gartner</a>, around 30% of data within CRM systems is outdated within 12 months.\n\nA critical side effect to a lack of quality data is poor prospect and customer relationships, which counteracts the purpose of CRM tools. Not to mention, purging bad data is inefficient and costly, resulting in lost opportunities and wasted time. Studies show that sales reps waste <a href=\"https://salesintel.io/blog/how-and-why-bad-crm-data-is-hurting-your-sales-team-performance-and-b2b-lead-generation/#:~:text=When%20poor%20data%20flows%20into,ultimately%20fail%20to%20be%20met.\">27%+</a> of their time recovering from bad CRM data.\n<h4>2. Spreadsheets Are Antiquated and Outdated</h4>\nWith poor CRM data driving inefficiencies in sales forecasts, it is necessary for companies to examine their data input methodologies. A majority of companies have used and continue to run their forecasting in Excel, leveraging Excel’s built in forecasting, regression, and data analysis tools. However, in the new digital landscape of automation, this traditional forecasting method has been proven to be inefficient, complex, and prone to error.\n\nWith an abundant amount of data cramped into sales forecast spreadsheets, it can be difficult to identify what data is really important and meaningful. Moreover, merging multiple spreadsheet files into a consolidated file is difficult and time-consuming. The more spreadsheets and higher volume of data it holds, the more prone they are to human errors, resulting in misreporting. In contrast to sales forecasting software, Excel sheets rarely keep up with real time data and constantly changing market and consumer needs.\n<h4>3. Time Series Forecasting Approach:</h4>\nThe time series forecasting methodology is another pitfall of ineffective sales forecasting. This approach predicts future values based on past data in relation to previous sales. Thus, the time series forecasting method fails to take into account constantly evolving consumer demands, market trends, and economic changes. Rather than implementing this approach as the foundation of the forecast, it should be used solely as a benchmark or method of comparison.\n<h4>4. Cognitive Biases &amp; Lack of Personal Accountability</h4>\nA major disadvantage to manual data entry is cognitive biases. Whether we realize it or not, we are all consistently influenced by unconscious biases and heuristics, especially when making tough decisions where the outcome is unknown. If left unidentified, we can become our own worst enemy when it comes to building an accurate sales forecast. A recent study showed that nearly <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-improve-forecast-performance-reducing-human-bias-jonathon-karelse/\">90%</a> of Demand Planners were impacted by a tendency to consistently over (or under) estimate in one direction. Inaccurate forecasting due to predispositions can negatively impact business or investing decisions and can lead to irrational actions due to misinformation.\n\nLastly, a common barrier to manual data entry is the lack of accountability. Forecasting is more than just having the facts at hand. It’s also about making informed judgments and insights driven by your data. If not treated as a critical component to the forecasting process, sales reps may be more inclined to manipulate data to make their forecasts appear higher. This may lead to overconfidence about winning deals, as well as sandbagging to lower management’s expectations or delay reporting until it suits them best.\n<h3><strong>Solutions &amp; Best Practices:</strong></h3>\n<h4></h4>\n<h4>Automated Sales Forecasting</h4>\nWith AI-driven data and insights, your sales forecast can better inform pipeline inspection and deal management to drive timely team actions. Unlike traditional sales forecast methods, machine learning tools generate real-time, accurate data on forecasting solutions within seconds. Sales reps can even run automated what-if scenarios with data-driven insights without having to worry about any cognitive biases. Most importantly, auto machine learning software is built to get smarter over time, thus generating more accurate forecasts simultaneously.\n\nAutomating your sales forecasting methodology not only improves data quality, but also saves time, effort, and money so your sales teams can focus their attention on things that matter most. Adopting and implementing powerful, yet affordable, computing software is the ultimate bang for your buck.\n\nLearn more about the advantages AI Guided Forecasting by clicking on the image below:<a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/the-top-3-ways-ai-guided-forecasting-beats-spreadsheets/\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10282 size-full\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Group-1327.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1406\" height=\"1151\" /></a>\n<h4>Sales Leadership</h4>\nTo combat barriers of accountability throughout the forecasting process, it is essential for sales leaders to verbalize the importance of sales forecasting accuracy. Holding meetings and weekly forecast calls can ensure regular inspection and execution by your sales reps and teams. Moreover, sales leaders should focus on key metrics and explain how that data is being used and what it is being used for. Data is the foundation to an accurate forecast and placing an emphasis on its importance will result in higher levels of compliance with data entry.\n<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>\nAt Aviso, we place our customers at the very forefront.

		"content": "The way B2B businesses have made sales and gained customers hasn’t changed much over the last several decades. However, the traditional sales process of assigning a representative to a territory, having them scour through long lists of potential opportunities, and push their product knowledge and its benefits to strangers in hopes of building a relationship that’ll lead to a lasting account is now becoming ineffective. This isn’t entirely a fault of the process itself, but more so due to the nature of today’s buyer behaviors. The buyers of today are making more virtual purchases than ever before, so a virtual sales process is key to tapping in to the massive amount of revenue generated by this generation.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10271\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TypicalSalesProcess_1_50-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1365\" />\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Millennials are increasingly making up more of the workforce, meaning that B2B buyers are no longer old-school decision makers. We all know how today’s B2C transactions are carried out for the most part — self-research and online purchases with little to no in-person or human contact. This was the trend even before 2020, with the Covid-19 pandemic only amplifying it and prompting businesses to accelerate their digital technology adoption. As a result, millennials are transferring their B2C buyer behaviors over to their B2B buyer roles. Most want a convenient digital interaction that is quicker and easier to execute than having to invest time in potentially multiple in-person meetings with a rep on a product or service that may not even be a fit after all.</span>\n\nIn fact, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelesmith100/\">Michael Smith</a>, Senior Managing Director at Blue Ridge Ventures, states in his <a href=\"https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/document/C4E1FAQEqa5__kZzPGA/feedshare-document-pdf-analyzed/0/1583939126211?e=1608152400&amp;v=beta&amp;t=kJIyavvDiJiNPdqGSr0qONjUrmeQhDCAYw9BwzJpkfM\">Executive Briefing on The Virtual Sales Role</a> that businesses ought to consider creating Virtual Account Executive (VAE) roles in order to satisfy the preferences of the modern B2B buyer. Differing from the traditional AE expertise based on instincts and experience, the VAE will be trained in digital skills that rely on a more data-driven, objective approach with prospects. The VAE role is important to consider as Gartner reports that “60% of B2B sales organizations will transition from experience- and intuition-based selling to data-driven selling by 2025.”<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10266\" style=\"caret-color: #456381; color: #456381;\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/VS-process-VAE-image-1.png\" alt=\"Michael Smith quote on VAE\" width=\"1200\" height=\"600\" /><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Are you ready to modernize the antiquated “7-Step Sales Process” or MEDDIC method by bringing virtual attributes to it along with advanced analytics powered by AI and machine-learning? You are? Great. Let’s get into how to create an effective virtual sales process that works.</span>\n\nTo combat the time-squandering action of finding the right opportunities that often leave reps with more uncertainty and not enough understanding of best-fit prospects, AI uses machine learning models to consume massive amounts of data to then generate accurate insights on deals that reps can take direct action on. Sales leaders should employ these guided selling tools to enable their team to spend more time with prospective customers and less time navigating through the CRM.\n\n<strong>Before the week starts,</strong> sales managers receive a weekly briefing generated by AI with the most up-to-date info on deals, a forecast on which deals should be closed by week-end, and the status of each rep in their quota cycle. These briefings show the managers and reps which opportunities should be prioritized in order to reach quota goals.\n\n<strong>In the beginning of the week,</strong> managers can hop on a forecast call with executive leadership and sales operations to ensure the forecast is where it needs to be and allocate any resources that may be needed. Managers can then view a dashboard of the status of all deals and review specific deals with reps to create a game plan for a successful close.\n\n<strong>By mid-week,</strong> reps will receive timely “nudges” from AI with guided actions relevant to achieving their goals. These nudges provide deal-specific insights and recommendations that reps can act on to turn the opportunity into an account.\n\n<strong>Finally, by the end of the week,</strong> sales managers can get an overview of which deals their team most engaged with to see how strong the relationship is with a certain opportunity. Managers can then utilize AI’s sales coaching recommendations that are based on a rep’s behavior, past sales calls or meetings, and historical deal patterns to see what needs to be done or changed in order to reach quota goals.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10275\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AvisoAISalesProcess_44-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1584\" height=\"1056\" />\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">As you can see, this data-driven approach leads to more time spent on the right opportunities, better rep-specific coaching tips, a more accurate and reliable sales forecast, and a fluid collaboration between revenue teams to grow revenue faster and smarter. An AI-powered virtual sales process eliminates many challenges faced by sales professionals by doing a lot of the dirty work for them. No more tedious data entry, sifting through endless lists of contacts trying to find a match, or wasting time building fickle forecasts. However, it’s important to consider the rising IT costs associated with the rapid adoption of digital business technologies. To keep costs low, get the best of CRM tools such as Salesforce, SAP, Oracle, and collaborative tools such as Slack, Zoom, and Gong, all combined into one revenue intelligence platform with Aviso AI. </span>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/platform/\">Platform page</a> to learn more.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

		"title": "How To Use AI To Boost Business Confidence In A VUCA World",
		"image": "https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Facebook-Post-1-286x150.png",
		"content": "Today's world has been described as the new normal, business as unusual\" and even \"permaweird.\" In companies around the globe:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Sales agents and marketers are asking: How am I supposed to grow client relationships without in-person interactions?</li>\n \t<li>Team managers are asking: How can we understand which customer relationships are working, and evaluate team members appropriately?</li>\n \t<li>The C-suite is wondering: How can we forecast reliably and trust our sales pipeline amid all this chaos and volatility?</li>\n</ul>\nIn this post, I will introduce a framework, VUCA, and describe how AI can help businesses boost confidence.\n<h4><strong>False Versus True Confidence: The Hardest Question</strong></h4>\nVUCA stands for \"volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity\" of conditions. Coined by the U.S. Army War College as a way to describe the multipolar world after the Cold War, the concept has applicability beyond its original roots, especially for global businesses dealing with new health, economic and environmental crises.\n\nHere's a simple way to illustrate the framework. Are you and your team:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Facing rapid change, the magnitude of which is unpredictable (i.e., you're facing customer demand that's changing wildly)? <strong>That's Volatility.</strong></li>\n \t<li>Feeling unclear about the present and future (i.e., you don't know if you will run a Black Friday sale in 2021)? That's Uncertainty.</li>\n \t<li>Experiencing chaos because of different factors acting at the same time (i.e., your CRM supplier in Spain was overrun by COVID-19)? That's Complexity.</li>\n \t<li>Feeling less aware and clear than usual (i.e., your customer says they want to buy more even though their industry is suffering)? That's Ambiguity.</li>\n</ul>\n<img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-9976\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/VUCA_graphic.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"601\" height=\"316\" />\n\nSurviving and growing confidence in VUCA environments is difficult, and that's where false versus true confidence comes in. In the first two quarters after the pandemic, many companies developed a veneer of false confidence from observing simplistic effects; for example, the bull run in the stock markets, or seamless work-from-home experiences with Zoom.\n\nHowever, I believe few businesses have true confidence during these uncertain times. Many aren't confident in the ability of their employees to adapt, or in the enduring strength of their business models. They don't have deep insights into customer behavior changes, sales activity and opportunity creation. Many are flying blind on pre-pandemic assumptions. True confidence comes from tackling the hardest questions, such as: What do we not know that could hurt us and put us out of business in a VUCA world?\n<h4><strong>Countering VUCA With Predictive AI</strong></h4>\nVUCA can paralyze a business. The best business leaders know that to counter VUCA, they need to systematically address each of its components:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Volatility: A North Star vision is essential. Knowing why a team is rowing in stormy waters helps teams tackle inclement weather, limited food rations and dangerous sea creatures.</li>\n \t<li>Uncertainty: Understanding the future by imagining scenario plans is crucial. This includes aggressive and conservative scenarios of what competitors and customers are likely to do, as well as learning from analogous domains.</li>\n \t<li>Complexity: Simplifying assumptions, messages and calls to action can increase clarity. Collaborating outside silos via sync/async work tools can help.</li>\n \t<li>Ambiguity: Moving quickly is key to not getting overwhelmed. Additionally, equipping teams with tools that help them overcome cognitive biases helps.</li>\n</ul>\nAI can help with the areas listed above to tackle VUCA. Specifically, in my current role as the CMO of an AI software company, I see firsthand how time-series predictive AI is addressing a VUCA world. Unlike simple AI implementations such as chatbots, it takes an agnostic approach to signals, machine learning and the delivery of insights and actions to end users.\n\nLet's look at an example from my industry, sales, which is a profession fraught with VUCA, and how predictive AI can equip virtual sales and marketing teams like never before. Narrow AI approaches tend to focus on single slices of the sales process, such as tracking emails or recording sales calls, aiming to \"improve\" that slice.\n\nTime-series predictive AI can look at all of the disparate data sets generated during a revenue cycle, across CRM, calendars or chat messages. It also decodes both explicit and implicit human behaviors driving sales with machine learning. Finally, by cross-linking this data, the AI closes the gap between forecasting and deal execution, building a positive loop with timely personal nudges and team-wide actions.\n\nSome of the complex VUCA questions to answer with this data include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Which deals are at risk? What deals from future quarters can be pulled in to meet this quarter's numbers?</li>\n \t<li>Where is the pipeline strong, and where is it running dry?</li>\n \t<li>Which team members are outperforming? How can we model others after them?</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Making It Real: How AI Guidance Can Counter VUCA To Empower Virtual Selling</h4>\nWhile sales and marketing teams are deprived of an invaluable superpower — the face-to-face, handshake-and-a-drink connection that humans treasure — AI guidance can help them turn long virtual selling cycles into wins.\n\nFor 40 years, tools like CRMs were designed and deployed for an analog-selling world. Suddenly, however, I've seen 10 years of steady movement from analog to virtual digital selling get compressed in less than a year. To navigate this acceleration with AI guidance, your company should:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Provide a North Star aspiration for your company's true revenue potential that takes into account its past success and its ability to pivot to virtual selling.</li>\n \t<li>Consolidate multiple chat, video and meeting tools into collaboration workspaces, with AI insights provided alongside human interaction (AI as extended team).</li>\n \t<li>Automatically update underlying systems of record, such as your CRM, by capturing sales rep and team activity exhaust and only nudging teams with the field that is directly correlated with deal success.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>A Compass For A VUCA Decade</h4>\nEmbracing advanced frameworks like VUCA can help steer your team toward safety and growth, and applying technologies like predictive AI can help your company build new muscle to succeed. With the power of AI and the right strategy to guide you, you can better understand the past, optimize for the present and prepare for the best future outcomes.",

		"content": "The recent pandemic has led to unprecedented measures as efforts to restrict the spread of the virus persist. From shutting down restaurants and in-person stores to canceling large events, businesses around the globe have been forced to adapt to widespread shelter-in-place regulations.\n\nThe largest shock to companies, however, has been the transition of its employees to remote work from home and relocation. This shift has had major impacts on collaboration, both internally and externally, from time zone differences and technical issues to delayed updates and slow response times. Beyond this, go-to-market and sales teams can no longer meet with customers face-to-face, which greatly impacts their sales processes and efficiency.\n\nNonetheless, as people have started spending more time at home, there has been a sharp rise in demand for digital collaboration and selling solutions. As a response, B2B sellers are uncovering new opportunities to optimize their sales execution by leveraging virtual selling tools, which include video conferencing, chat rooms, and virtual meetings. <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-b2b-digital-inflection-point-how-sales-have-changed-during-covid-19\">According to McKinsey</a>, more than 90% of B2B companies have transitioned to a virtual sales model during this time, replacing face-to-face sales conversations with synchronous and asynchronous communications.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9769\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/90-Quote-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"946\" />\n\nUtilizing advanced technology to drive optimal sales execution on all levels of the revenue cycle has become an increasingly sought-after approach to bridging the gap between the office and WFH.

		"content": "Sales pipelines can often be an enigma – a vague swirl of CRM, convoluted spreadsheets, audacious revenue targets, and irregular team meetings to discuss a “pipeline” that often seems more time-consuming than anything. However, pipeline drive remains a major indicator of future revenue, and having a strong pipeline drive is key to managing risk and driving revenue growth.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10986 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GPBP-Quote-1-1-571x300.png\" alt=\"Graphic on pipeline drive showing companies with effective pipeline management grow revenue 15% faster than companies that don't. Jennifer Wang.\" width=\"571\" height=\"300\" />Yet, pipeline generation is a source of struggle for many sales leaders, who may be forced to rely on antiquated tools with limited visibility like spreadsheets and CRM reports to draw out insights for future action.\n\nIn addition, teams must now adjust to the additional unforeseen variable of Covid-19. Even the most rock-solid of pipelines can falter as a result of the onset of an economic downturn, with McKinsey predicting that <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/safeguarding-our-lives-and-our-livelihoods-the-imperative-of-our-time\">over 50% of businesses will cut their spending</a> in response to pandemic conditions.\n\nAs Q4 approaches and the market cautiously re-opens, opportunities for business rebound and growth are popping up. Nevertheless, the quality of the existing pipeline may be questionable, given the inadequacy of relevant historical data and personal predictions to address the current economic climate.\n<h3>Sales pipelines created before and after the pandemic are valued differently.</h3>\nBecause different business and individual buying behavior have each been affected differently by the pandemic, pipeline created before the pandemic is no longer trustworthy. For instance, a company or persona you might have counted on to purchase your product may have been more impacted by the economic downturn than others. On the other hand, pipeline created after the pandemic is also more volatile as the global situation continues to oscillate. Sales managers and operations alike report that their pipelines are becoming foggy. Navigating waters of uncertainty can be especially difficult if your tools are increasingly unreliable.\n<h3>In these times of uncertainty, a change of tactics may be the answer.</h3>\nUsing advanced technologies that can offer deeper insight into the health and potential of a sales pipeline is one of the ways companies can see through the murky waters wrought by the pandemic. More specifically, AI guidance via <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/platform/#Agnostic-AI\">Auto-Machine Learning algorithms</a> offers a data-driven, objective option that helps sales teams maintain pipeline growth and boost revenue.\n\nIn situations like these where historical data and individual intuition are no longer reliable, AI guidance can provide the essential boon needed to navigate your deals in a world of chaos, allowing you to see into future pipeline one, two, even four quarters ahead.\n\nHere’s how AI-guided selling can help nurture your sales pipeline towards its revenue True North, from creation to cultivation to overcoming uncertainty.<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10988 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/StepsPastel-1-571x300.png\" alt=\"Graphic on steps for pipeline drive including adaptation, generation and growth. Jennifer Wang.\" width=\"571\" height=\"300\" />\n<h2>Generation</h2>\n<h3>Pipeline Planning</h3>\nSustained revenue is only possible when your pipeline strategy is long-term. By planning for the future, you can lay out a strategic pathway for your team to pursue and course-correct when necessary. <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/pipeline-acceleration/\">Aviso’s AI Pipeline Planning</a> feature provides insight into potential future pipelines and helps teams determine an optimal mix of opportunities for success.\n<h3>Pipeline Building</h3>\nBefore sales teams can successfully build pipeline, they must first have a sufficient foundation. Aviso AI surfaces analytics to identify <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/pipeline-acceleration/\">if the next quarter will start with enough pipeline</a>. Teams are notified when pipeline generation slows in specific regions or segments so they can respond as needed.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9786\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/second.png\" alt=\"Chart  and alert for next-quarter pipeline.

Advanced analytics provide a data-driven assessment as opposed to CRM self-reports. Teams can compare pipeline at the start of the quarter to new pipeline added to ending pipeline predictions, as well as compare human and AI forecast predictions to determine the source of discrepancies.\n\nAviso AI reveals when and where teams need to strengthen their efforts so that they can stay on track to creating sufficient pipeline one, two, or three quarters ahead. Aviso also highlights deals that have a shot of being won early.\n<h3>Intelligence Reports</h3>\nAviso AI’s <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/reports-analytics/\">Intelligence Reports</a> demonstrate the progressions of past, current, and future pipelines so that sales leaders can better understand their pipeline evolution through the quarter and evaluate the quality of the current and future pipeline.\n\nSales pipelines are dynamic, reflecting changes in customer and market conditions – something that can’t be accurately captured in simple CRM field updates. Aviso AI helps pinpoint exactly how, when, and where a pipeline has changed so teams can prevent and remedy deal slippage, as well as illuminate historical pipeline progression so teams can glean insight into how different factors have affected contribution.\n<h3>Pipeline Nudges</h3>\nWe understand that your time is valuable. Guided by big data and advanced machine-learning, Aviso AI’s timely <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/deal-guidance/\">Pipeline Nudges</a> provide sales teams with direct insight into deals at risk and what actions should be taken to advance them.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10989 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/third-1-419x300.png\" alt=\"Graph of growth in revenue from pipeline drive. Courtesy of Aviso product and design team.\" width=\"419\" height=\"300\" />\n<h2>Adaptation</h2>\n<h3>Covid-19 Risk Indicators</h3>\nHow can AI guidance help you overcome obstacles of uncertainty? Like a wise mentor, AI draws wisdom from deep learning of vast data sources to guide you on the right path to conquer even the most formidable of challenges.\n\nWithout a precise understanding of the pandemic’s economic impact on pipeline, teams can be led astray by their own predictions and evaluations. Aviso’s <a href=\"https://info.aviso.com/reduce-covid-19-revenue-risk\">Covid-19 Risk</a> Indicator provides sales teams with a robust appraisal of how the pandemic is affecting their current pipeline on the deal level. With AI pipeline guidance, you can not only survive but also <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/three-ways-ai-guidance-can-help-you-sell-better-in-a-black-swan-environment/\">thrive in the economy of a Black Swan</a>.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10990 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Pipeline_Pipeline-Planning-1-388x300.png\" alt=\"Pipeline drive graph that shows effect of Covid on revenue.

		"content": "Rigorous revenue forecasting is crucial to driving growth and to conveying confidence to your Board or Wall Street that your business is supported by a reliable forecasting machine that will scale well for future successes.\n\nHowever, most companies rarely meet forecasts. By making lowball forecasting a self-fulfilling prophecy, companies are leaving substantial value on the table. In other words, spreadsheet forecasting only reveals the tip of an iceberg of revenue: there is tremendous financial value to be unlocked if you can bring the entire iceberg to the surface.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9691\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Iceberg-V1-1.png\" alt=\"Iceberg analogy of revenue lodged in CRM versus  your true revenue potential.

McKinsey &amp; Co reports that <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/bringing-a-real-world-edge-to-forecasting\">only 8% of CFOs</a> express complete satisfaction with their forecasts, and the remaining cite the huge time sink and overall inaccuracy as major complaints.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9689\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8-Quote-1.png\" alt=\"92% of CFOs express dissatisfaction with their forecasting, according to McKinsey. Graphic by Jennifer Wang.\" width=\"526\" height=\"276\" />\n\nAI guided selling has its place as a solution for each of the different roles in a revenue team – guided deal navigation for reps, guided sales coaching for managers, and guided forecasting for sales operations. This article will explore the role that AI guided forecasting plays in solving the main issues rampant in traditional spreadsheet-based forecasting.\n\nHere are the top three reasons why businesses need to move on from spreadsheet forecasting:\n<h3>1. Spreadsheet forecasting is prone to human error.</h3>\n“Errors in spreadsheets are pandemic,” writes researcher Ray Panko, whose audit revealed that <a href=\"http://panko.com/ssr/Audits.html\">91% of spreadsheets contain important errors</a>.\n\nDespite our best wishes , faulty formulas and data entries can easily infiltrate spreadsheets. Managers must trust their sales team to consistently and competently clean up their data, which may not be feasible.  Filled with holes and clouded with human bias, these spreadsheet-based forecasts are fickle and costly: it only takes <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/forecasting-spreadsheets-dangerous/\">one faulty formula or a handful of mis-entered data points</a> to throw off your forecast, undermine the credibility of your sales team, and <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/88-of-spreadsheets-have-errors-2013-04-17?siteid=nwhfriend\">precipitate massive financial loss</a>. Natural human biases, rep turnover, policy changes – if companies are even slightly lax in making sure that their data is up to code, these factors can have a major negative impact on the forecast accuracy.\n<h3>2. Forecasts are largely overestimated.</h3>\nHubspot reports that only <a href=\"https://www.hubspot.com/sales-close-rate\">19% of deals across all industries</a> are actually closed -- with the finance industry claiming a 19% deal closure, IT with a slightly higher percentage at 21%, and healthcare at a low 17%. These low closure averages reveal a severe overestimation in predictions. You wouldn’t rely on your weather app if it was wrong 6 out of 7 days a week, so why settle for the same inaccuracy in your revenue forecasting?\n\nA major reason for this is <a href=\"https://www.saleshacker.com/cognitive-bias-sales/\">underlying cognitive bias</a>, which can cause wildly inaccurate forecast data entry. Many sales reps struggle with overconfidence bias, anchoring bias, and correspondence bias (also known as Fundamental Attribution Error). Unfortunately, underlying human nature can lead reps to believe that they have special ability, that they're exempt from statistical averages, or that sales is a game in which past behavior has little impact on their present choices.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9690\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Deal-Closure-Rates-1.png\" alt=\"Forecasted deal closure per industry. Graphic comparing healthcare, financial, and IT industries with percentage of forecasted deals closed. Graphic by Jennifer Wang.\" width=\"580\" height=\"304\" />\n\n<a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/forecasting-spreadsheets-dangerous/\">A significant portion of B2B tech companies</a> still uses a combination of CRM data and spreadsheets to produce their forecasts.  CRM reports, however, can only tell an incomplete story about the state of your business and are more than likely to be skewed by blind spots such as <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/5-blind-spots-in-your-crm/\">backdating and inaccurate listings</a>.  When combined with this distorted data, precarious spreadsheets can compound upon existing errors and displace predictions far from their actual truth value.\n<h3>3. Spreadsheet forecasting does not factor in social and economic volatility.</h3>\nBlack Swans like Covid-19 are extremely difficult to predict, much less forecast for. The particularly ever-shifting landscape of the digital era means that sales teams cannot simply rely on historical data to inform predictions. The pandemic has introduced new, unpredictable variables into the sales equation that are nearly impossible to model on Google Sheets.\n\nMoreover, organizations each employ their own unique way to predict revenue, with the most common methods including opportunity stage, intuitive, and historical forecasting. However, changes in both internal and external variables can easily throw these single-source predictions off. Multivariable forecasting is necessary to sufficiently address the dynamic nature of sales but is also incredibly complicated to execute consistently and competently on spreadsheets.\n\nDespite these challenges, there is hope: McKinsey reports that guided selling rooted in multivariate machine learning and objective artificial intelligence can <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/predictive-sales-forecasting-is-your-finance-function-up-to-code\">greatly reduce CRM pain points and re-orient forecasts</a>. Once businesses overcome the initial barriers of <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/adopt-ai-to-transform-forecasting/\">data quality, human bias, and employment reassurance</a>, they can embrace the linear course to success with a crystal-clear, AI-powered forecast.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9688\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-benefits-of-Aviso-2.png\" alt=\"Benefits of AI-guided forecasting: pinpoint accuracy, optimize resources, and align goals &amp; data. Graphic by Jennifer Wang.\" width=\"506\" height=\"386\" />\n\nHere’s how AI guided selling addresses the issues of spreadsheet forecasting and can help as a catalyst for businesses to grow confidently:\n<h4>1. Optimize Operations and Sales Resources for Higher Value-Added Tasks</h4>\nNo more fatigue of Friday afternoons spent staring at a swimming soup of numbers -- AI removes this burden and increased likelihood of cognitive error.\n\nInstead, advanced Auto-Machine Learning algorithms can cut down on <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/crm-automation/\">30% of the large allocations of time, money, and human labor</a> spent on data entry and complicated calculations. Data is efficiently aggregated and analyzed for sales teams, who can focus on closing deals instead of chaperoning their CRM.\n\nFor operations teams, AI forecasting helps to hone in on forward-facing what-if scenario planning instead of looking in the rearview mirror and focusing on past behaviors. For sales teams, AI guidance can help cultivate effective strategies on how to beat the quarter instead of meandering discussions about deals that would only help them reach the minimum quota target.\n<h4>2. Make 98%+ Accuracy the Default and Permanently Raise the Bar</h4>\nAlgorithms can approach the objective truth with far more accuracy than spreadsheets can – such as with <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/predictive-forecasting/\">Aviso’s 98% accuracy in predictive forecasting. </a>\n\nCompared to the 19% industry-wide deal close rate, the near-perfect accuracy of data-driven AI is leaps and bounds ahead of manual human calculation, and can greatly mitigate the huge financial risk of human error and overestimation. Aviso AI is a robust, multivariate solution, informed by multiple sources and perspectives rather than solely CRM. Utilizing big data and advanced machine-learning algorithms, Aviso incorporates factors of socioeconomic shift into its prediction and allows flexibility to <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/three-ways-ai-guidance-can-help-you-sell-better-in-a-black-swan-environment/\">make modifications for Black Swans.</a>\n\nHowever, human predictions are still valuable: AI guidance is meant to inform forecasts rather than override, to offer a more objective point of view into the win-rate of your deals. Users at every level of the sales hierarchy -- from CFOs to operations to managers to reps -- can compare their own predictions with that of the AI.\n<h4>3. Align Best of Human and AI Strengths to Capture all the Value in a Quarter</h4>\nA lack of data alignment can be particularly risky, especially when it <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54422505?fbclid=IwAR1SeOZzhY5tbCa1oTFqJZM6j94DMwd1hQURNJSLH0oF6bjvtpCXUlvLBVY\">involves the private information of a large number of people</a>. With one universal AI-guided sales software, forecasts and changes are implemented across all levels and data sets. Different departments and levels of hierarchy can work together to mitigate the effects of Black Swans.\n\nIn addition, these dynamic forecasts keep you on track towards your revenue goals. Like an Apple Watch tracks your vitals and alerts you of health irregularities, Aviso AI monitors your sales activities, ensuring that they stay on track, and sends alerts so that your team can course-correct when needed. Aviso provides actionable nudges to increase chances of deal closure, easy access to forecast rooms for in-depth discussion, and <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/conversational-intelligence/\">SmartTranscriptions</a> of forecasting calls to align what was discussed versus what is actually done.\n\nWith data-driven AI guidance, your sales teams can escape the risky business of spreadsheet forecasting, clearly discern the efficacy of their actions, and gain an in-depth understanding of deal closures.\n\nInterested in learning more about AI guided selling?

		"content": "COVID-19 has catalyzed a shift from traditional offices to work-from-home (WFH). This shift poses an assortment of new challenges for employees all over the globe. Sales teams, in particular, must confront unique changes to remote selling in a digital landscape. Gone are the coffee chats, restaurant reservations, and backstage interactions that once functioned to cultivate relationships with customers; the sales process is now confined to virtual interaction. Digital sales coaching is now more important to teams than ever before.\n\nWhile adapting to a newfound prospect ecosystem, sales reps must also face precarious economic conditions spurred by the pandemic. Businesses are now more conservative in their expenditures than before.\n\nFor instance, Bain &amp; Co. reports that <a href=\"https://www.bain.com/insights/technology-budgets-hit-hard-by-covid-19-snap-chart/\">more than half of US businesses have cut their budgets for technology hardware, software, and services this year, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and related economic fallout</a>. This means that sales reps have to work even harder to sell their products and services to meet their quotas. Below, we outline why reps need virtual sales coaching now more than ever. We also discuss how AI can upgrade and streamline the coaching process.\n<h3><strong>Great Sales Coaching Drives Great Revenue But is Hard to Execute</strong></h3>\nGood revenue leaders know that improving sales training and coaching <a href=\"https://accent-technologies.com/2016/08/16/10-powerful-statistics-sales-training/\">can significantly improve their revenue performance</a>, especially during the era of virtual selling.\n\nMethods of sales coaching are unique and tailored to each individual company and most companies have some version of a training program. Some companies use online personal training programs, whereas others focus on manager-led sessions. Regardless of approach, the question that remains to be answered is whether these methods are effective.\n\nResearch conducted by Gartner has found that B2B sales reps forget 70% of the information they learn within a week of training, and 87% will forget it within a month. Evidently, knowledge retention is an issue that must be addressed with continuous sales coaching. Organizations have traditionally relied on in-personal training, which can be difficult to implement across larger cohorts and differing locations. Technology offers a solution to this issue, providing opportunities for scalable, personalized learning.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11077 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Gartner-Quote-2-1-1-1-571x300.png\" alt=\"Graphic stating B2B sales reps forget 70% of the information they learn within a week of training, according to Gartner. Graphic by Jennifer Wang.\" width=\"571\" height=\"300\" />\n<h3><strong>Virtual Sales Coaching to the Rescue During a Global Pandemic</strong></h3>\nGiven the conditions, sales reps face two main challenges:\n<ol>\n \t<li>Adaptation to virtual selling</li>\n \t<li>Selling in an economic downturn</li>\n</ol>\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9356\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Sales-Coaching-B4-and-After-1.png\" alt=\"AI sales coaching showing impacts of Covid-19 and AI-powered sales coaching. Graphic by Jennifer Wang.\" width=\"624\" height=\"327\" />\n\nSales managers <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/adjust-to-the-reality-of-virtual-selling/\">must translate</a> traditional goals of customer relationship and loyalty investment into digital channels. This involves emphasizing consistency in messaging and communication, promotion of company branding across platforms and conversations, faster demonstrations of value, and bolstering of sales team virtual literacy and morale.\n<h3><strong>Augment Sales Coaching with Algorithmic or AI Guided Selling</strong></h3>\nAs of 2020, Gartner predicts that AI algorithms will be part of the sales processes of 30% of all B2B companies. Companies that deploy AI technologies have reported reduced costs, increased efficiency, and enhanced revenue streams.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11078 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Gartner-Quote-3-1-571x300.png\" alt=\"Gartner: 30% of all B2B companies will employ some kind of AI to augment at least one of their primary sales processes. Graphic by Jennifer Wang.\" width=\"571\" height=\"300\" />\n\nAside from augmenting the sales processes, AI has demonstrated incredible potential for sales coaching, a feature that very few organizations take advantage of. “<a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-evolution-of-sales-training-and-coaching-technology/\">Algorithms will show sellers what training to take, what material to send and who to call next,”</a> says Melissa Hilbert, a Senior Director Analyst at Gartner. Machine learning provides role-based, flexible training that analyzes the efficacy of learning methods and adapts to individual needs and learning styles.\n<h3><strong>Custom Sales Coaching Insights &amp; Manager-Rep Collaboration</strong></h3>\nAviso offers a solution for this industry need, presenting an AI-based platform that addresses the aforementioned pain points and optimizes sales coaching initiatives. Here’s how Aviso can help:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Collaborative Coaching Rooms.</strong> As part of Aviso’s Digital WarRooms, coaching rooms provide a streamlined space for managers and reps to collaborate remotely with high efficiency.<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9347\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Collaboration-Coaching-rooms.png\" alt=\"Message screenshot showing digital sales coaching feature. Graphic courtesy to Aviso product and design teams.\" width=\"397\" height=\"179\" /></li>\n \t<li><strong>Individualized Rep Scorecards.</strong> Coaching rooms include sales rep scorecards, which outline a rep’s overall performance in relation to their actions, such as closing deals and building relationships with key account stakeholders. Managers can easily access these comprehensive analyses and tailor their coaching accordingly.<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9348\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Collaboration-Sales-Owner-Scorecard.png\" alt=\"Digital sales coaching features dashboard screencapture. Graphic courtesy of Aviso product and design teams.\" width=\"435\" height=\"362\" /></li>\n \t<li><strong>Personalized Sales Management.</strong> Aviso compiles data on the individual deals that a sales rep is an owner of, provide veritable reports into the reasons behind a deal’s performance, and generates actionable sales coaching insights. Sales managers can dive into the individual details of each deal and make evidence-based suggestions for improvement.</li>\n</ol>\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9349\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Panel_WinScoreInsights-2.png\" alt=\"Win score insights feature view. Graphic courtesy of Aviso design and product team.\" width=\"240\" height=\"352\" />\n\nVirtual selling is here to stay for the foreseeable future, and remote employment has altered the way sales teams must address their goals and tackle their quotas. Sales coaching is one way to mitigate risk and boost revenue in a new digital ecosystem. As a result, organizations can better cultivate customer relationships, augment sales strategies in a virtual setting, and maximize growth.\n\nWe recommend using a cohesive, centralized platform for sales managers to examine the actions of their reps and coach them effectively. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/398120318\">Check out this video</a> to see sales rep coaching with AI in action.",

		"content": "In this blog segment, we had the chance to speak with Aviso Advisory Board Member, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-stratton-8b363a/\">Brad Stratton</a>, current CRO at <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/venafi/\">Venafi</a> and former EVP of Worldwide Sales at <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/talend/\">Talend</a>. Brad has led enormous revenue growth for several enterprise companies and has a very successful track record of optimizing sales forces to mitigate churn and increase retention.\n\nWe asked Brad how AI can help companies with their pipeline predictability to overcome periods of downturn and improve preparedness for the future. Brad had some phenomenal answers based on his excellent history of driving revenue to IPO and acquisition.\n\nIn this blog, you’ll find videos of Brad’s interview on how he feels today’s businesses can benefit from using smart, AI-guided forecasting and predictability to keep the pipeline flowing.\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/YM-47T2U0IM\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9258 size-full\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Brad-Stratton-1_-Career-Journey.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: Can you share your career journey with us?</strong>\n\n<strong>Brad: </strong>I started out in the medical industry and was lucky enough to get into PTC as a leader fairly early in my career. It dates me but it's been a long time. PTC was really the ground zero for, I would say, sales practices, especially around qualification in medic, and a sales process that really held true and has continued to hold true with the likes of myself and a bunch of other CROs.\n\nWith John McMahon being the leader of the pack, if you will, in terms of driving sales methodology throughout the software world. It translated really well to the SaaS industry. So that's where I started, then I went on to 12 years in the call center industry with the likes of Witness Systems which was acquired by Verint for a billion dollars in 2007. Then we did a bunch of acquisitions, which were a lot of fun.\n\nThen I went on to Talend, which I think many people will know went public in 2016. We grew that business from $50 million to $250 million during my tenure there. I did use Aviso my whole five years there. Then, I've since recently joined Venafi and they had used Aviso, sparingly prior to my arrival. And that has been my journey.\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/TpR8O0ccuYU\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9283 size-full\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Brad-Stratton-2_-The-Difference-with-the-Current-Downturn.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a> <strong>Aviso: What’s different about the current COVID downturn as compared to previous slowdowns?</strong>\n\n<strong>Brad: </strong>I experienced a bit of a downturn in 2001, 2002. EMC at the time, I was there briefly, went from $8 billion to $6 billion in one year. That was probably the most drastic in terms of my career just because they had massive layoffs and other things that drastically affected the company.\n\nIn 2007, and now, I've been lucky enough to be at companies that the problem they solved was so significant that it really didn't change the trajectory of the company much. When I was in the call center industry in 2007, what happens in the world of a downturn is that people will tend to start focusing on their existing customer base to prevent churn.\n\nAnd that was the case in 2007 in Verint, our products, a lot of what I did at the time was focused around preventing churn, especially for large companies. So, we didn't really feel the effects of it back then. Then here at Venafi, the problem we solve, with respect to machine identity protection, becomes even more critical because in the world of security and bad guys and hacking, things get bad; and worse in the environments like we're in because people don't have jobs and they do bad stuff.\n\nAnd when they do bad stuff, I don't know if you have ever seen that movie, “Fun with Dick and Jane”, with Jim Carrey where he goes out and everybody goes and robs the banks and gets in trouble. So, a little bit of that happens in the world of security. Venafi has done fairly well in this environment because we've continued to focus on our problem statement and it's resonated well in the customer base.\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/2ZZvPoZF0eg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9284 size-full\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Brad-Stratton-3_-Forecasting-with-AI-at-Talend-_-Venafi.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: </strong><strong>How did Aviso help you with forecasting predictability and high growth at Talend and Venafi?</strong>\n\n<strong>Brad: </strong>With Talend, we did an evaluation against a couple of different folks and my head of Sales Ops and I, Tim Sjobeck. He and I chose Aviso at the time, mostly focused on just around forecasting. We wanted to get predictability because we bought it in, I think late 2014-early 2015 and it was all about heading us towards an IPO.\n\nThe two things that are required to be a successful IPO is obviously high growth in a software company, but just as important is predictability because Wall Street guys don't have much penchant for missing a quarter. So, going into an IPO you have to be prepared and have the right metrics so that you can really beat and raise for four to six quarters.\n\nEspecially in a SaaS company where the revenue follows a year later. So much of predictability happens the year before. So, forecasting and being consistent in your forecasting is really important. That was the focus of why we bought it.\n\nAt Talend, some of the capabilities have expanded, and we started to use it for other things. But frankly, the predictive engine didn't really get good until probably five quarters in because it needed to be able to assimilate the information, the people, the changes, etc. So, once we got burning, I would say late 2015-early 2016, before we IPO’d, we started to really be able to predict the forecast fairly well because of the AI.\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/JjhEDwmdiZs\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9285 size-full\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Brad-Stratton-4_-Role-of-AI-in-Business-Predictability.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: How do you look at the role of AI in driving predictability and preparedness?</strong>\n\n<strong>Brad: </strong>Growth and predictability are really the keys to the business. You can grow geographically, you can grow just by hiring more headcount, you can grow with different types of headcount, and you can grow through the channel.\n\nHaving the visibility into what's working in your organization is really important to understand what buttons to push on the different parameters as it relates to growth to build your capacity and drive your model, right? So that's growth.\n\nPredictability, I think, comes in ultimately two forms. One, the forecast stuff I talked about, which obviously is the core of what Aviso is. But more importantly, is pipeline. Everybody measures pipeline in so many different ways. You’re measuring ratios to the number that you need to make for the quarter, and you're measuring it by industry, and by rep, and all this stuff. The thing you have to be careful of, and this is also true in AI with respect to growth, is you can't change the way in which you do pipeline-build and/or how you look at your forecast over and over or every two, three quarters and reevaluate how you're measuring things because if you do that the AI engine is going to break.\n\nSo, I always say that pipeline in sales is if you have a consistent way in which you teach people to build it, and then hold people accountable to that result, obviously you can’t compensate for pipeline, you're going to get a consistent pipeline-build, but also a consistent way in which you’re doing it which doesn't disrupt the AI.\n\nIt’s always kind of like it's a pyramid, there's always pieces of it that are really good and some of it that's kind of smelly. But the reality is as long as you have a consistent way to build it, then you can have a consistent way to measure it.\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/DArJ45pO4KE\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9286 size-full\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Brad-Stratton-5_-Advice-for-CROs-and-Sales-Leaders.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: How to successfully manage the COVID driven shift to digital selling?</strong>\n\n<strong>Brad: </strong>The personal interaction pieces are kind of going away. I think you just have to embrace it. We just had a global summit, where last year we had a few hundred people come. And this year, we were expecting to have 600 people show up to it, and we had twice that. The participation rate was somewhere near 60% in terms of somebody staying more than two hours to our global summit.\n\nSo, things like that where you just can embrace and do so much more digitally. Everything you do online and digitally you can track everything. So that gives you more data to work with and ultimately if you can create some sort of an AI to be able to understand, ‘what is driving attribution?’ The biggest hole in all of marketing throughout time is attribution, right? If you can't get really good attribution, then you don't understand the buyer’s journey in marketing and how it aligns with the buyer’s journey in sales.\n\nI think the buyer’s journey in sales in the world of COVID is becoming more data-driven, and Zoom-driven, which is what it is. There are all kinds of tools you can use now. You can use things like recording tools, I know Aviso has some of that, Gong, and those type of things to be able to get more data about what your teams are doing so you can educate them better and move things along faster.\n\nI think the one great thing about COVID for us has been particular customers who've given us probably more access than they ever have in the past. Because they're not commuting and they have time to talk to us and we've had, I would say, much more transparent Zoom conversations maybe even now than and we'd ever had in the past just over the phone.\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/zVGbvXjwFrc\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9287 size-full\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Brad-Stratton-6_-Manage-Customer-Churn-with-AI.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: How can AI help manage churn and customer success focus during COVID?</strong>\n\n<strong>Brad: </strong>We got pretty in front of that here at Venafi. I won't tell you our number, but our renewal rate is in the high 90s. So, it's pretty unprecedented in the SaaS space.\n\nOne of the reasons I came here because obviously that tells you what a great product it is if people renew at that rate. So that's great for us, but we still wanted to focus on it because we didn't know what was going to happen. Especially in the early parts of March, we were like, “Holy crap. What's gonna happen here?”\n\nWe started to get really proactive about it. We started sending out billing notices 120 days in advance versus our typical 60. We had a bunch of things we started to measure. One, we had an S.A., our pre-sales architects, call every single one of our customers and just had a general kind of list of questions that we had them asking to help qualify where they stood.\n\nMostly it was an informal discussion. These are people that have had discussions with these people before. And then, we had them scale and rank those customers’ propensity to churn. Then, we did all kinds of other analysis in terms of what industry people were in and whether that was gonna make them susceptible.\n\nAnd we also looked at our data inside the forecasting tools: how many customers had in the last three months looked at or taken a quote from us from another product? So, we felt like they were already looking at another product that was obviously an opportunity for an upsell, but it also meant that we had much less propensity to churn.\n\nWe took about four or five pieces of this data and we’ve enhanced it a little bit since. We built a propensity-to-churn score that we kept track of. We're continuing to do that because the rest of the year is really important and we want to make sure we're in front of our churning. Funny enough, our churn has been just a little bit ahead of our projection which we were surprised by.",

		"content": "<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"></h2>\nWe were delighted to sit down with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulrchapman/\">Paul Chapman</a>, a highly experienced Sales and Revenue tech executive, to learn from his experiences on how to stay resilient when everything is business as unusual. Paul was formerly the CIO of HP Software at <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/hewlett-packard-enterprise/\">Hewlett Packard Enterprise</a> and is currently Global CIO at cloud content management and file-sharing company, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/box/\">Box</a>. He recently joined the Aviso Advisory Board.\n\nWhile speaking with Paul, we were interested in learning about his insights and outlooks on the current state of business operations in this new remote world we’re living in. We were curious to pick his brain regarding his tremendous experience with collaboration software and a strong operations lens. Below, you’ll find various video snippets and their transcriptions of our conversation with Mr. Chapman as he shares the importance of technological adaptation, remote company culture, and business resiliency.\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/IQrjgGV_Zmk\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9267 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Paul-Chapman-1_-Business-as-Unsual.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Aviso: What do you see as the new normal, and how do you see the world look moving forward?</strong>\n\n<strong>Paul: </strong>There's no blueprint for the current situation. It's not like a lot of situations where we have some historical references or some rearview-mirror data that we can look at that allows us to predict where we're headed here. So, I think one of the key things is early on we all had to move very quickly to adjust to this working remote, which by the way seems such like a legacy conversation, now three-four months ago.\n\nWe've all learned a tremendous amount in the past few months. I think now that we've transitioned to working remotely, for the most part successfully, the conversations have now really shifted to your point of “what does the future new normal or business as unusual look like?” I do believe we're going to come out of this with a much stronger way of working globally. I've spent the last few months talking to and being involved in literally hundreds of technology leader interactions and conversations.\n\nCertainly a few things have emerged that I think are relatively consistent. I think one of those is around what's happening to technology budgets and investments. I think major projects, ERP upgrades, and large enterprise-systems implementations have slowed down, been paused, or canceled. COVID for sure has accelerated the digital agenda and digital transformation efforts across almost every industry.\n\nAnd certainly, it looks like as we go forward here, the remote workforce is here to stay certainly post-COVID. Our workforce is certainly going to be more virtual, collaborative, and tech-savvy in the future. I do think that every business process is now a target for automation. I think we're going to see, and we are seeing, a significant push for investments in accelerating digital architecture and business resiliency.\n\nIt's a great opportunity for technology leaders to have the courage to stand tall and accelerate digital agenda and transformation. And as we look forward, I think most organizations believe the re-entry will be gradual. It's certainly far more complex moving back than it was moving to remote work. I think we've proven we can work effectively in a remote way now.\n\nI think employees are wanting more flexible schedules. Productivity has generally gone up in most places. I think there's going to be a reluctance to rush back into the office, especially after mandatory self-quarantine is lifted. And we're dealing with such a patchwork quilt of government and state regulations and so on. I think building campuses are going to change. There's a lot of things that I think in the future, or business as unusual, that are going to be different, but I think we're going to learn a lot and they're going to be better.\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/qM4bYKKA9do\"><img class=\"wp-image-9268 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Paul-Chapman-2_-Role-of-CIO-in-Remote-Work.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: How can CIOs work through their critical technology enablers to support remote work?</strong>\n\n<strong>Paul: </strong>I would caution on calling it extended remote work, I think it's here to stay. And I don't think it's around making short-term decisions, it's around making long-term decisions. I think that we're in the early stages here right now. And without an effective vaccine, we're going to be in this operating mode for quite some time. So, I think this is the opportunity to make the right investments that are actually the long-term investments.\n\nI think that as companies moved quickly and adopted, maybe new tools and new ways of working, the platforms of course that we saw had a dramatic increase in usage were services that supported any form of conversation exchange or collaboration and so on. Sort of that communication fabric for an organization. And of course, we've seen what's happened with services like Zoom, and WebEx, and Slack, and Teams. And even services like Box as well.\n\nWe've seen a significant increase in the adoption and usage of our platform for sharing, collaboration, and secure remote work. Email actually, surprisingly, and maybe I shouldn't say surprisingly, it's been around for 50 years, and I think people are still addicted to email. But I think that those are the base-level services that are now if you have those types of services in place, are proving to be extremely valuable.\n\nI think organizations that may have had a maybe a more legacy technology footprint struggled to transition. I think the one thing though that I would also caution is, of course, is that responding to a crisis like this does not mean security threats or compliant risks are any less pervasive. And in fact, we have seen it at Box and I know other technology leaders have as well, an uptake in COVID-19 malware attacks leveraging bogus news articles around COVID, malicious emails, and things like that.\n\nSo, the attack surface has changed. And I think that anytime we're thinking about new technologies and new services, we have to make sure we're thinking through our security architecture and building security in as we accelerate our digital agenda.\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/l3OHVin5x7Y\"><img class=\"wp-image-9269 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Paul-Chapman-3_-Aviso-Advisor.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: What motivated you to join Aviso as a Board Advisor?</strong>\n\n<strong>Paul:</strong> As a technology leader, I gravitate towards being forward-thinking and innovative in nature. And that's something that I look for in other technologies and services and companies, even in their culture. Companies that are forward-thinking and innovative in the way they operate, the way they think, the way they behave, are very important to me. Because you can learn so much from partnering with organizations like that.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, every business processing function is under pressure to automate more—specifically in sales. You want your sales team to be spending their most valuable time on the lifeblood of any organization which is your customers and generating revenue. You want them to be working on the highest value work and not spending time inside of CRM systems, staring at limited data sets, and trying to deduce actionable insights from that.\n\nYou don't want predictions and forecasting that's made from limited data sets, gut feel, finger in the air, generally siloed sets of data. And I think that with Aviso, you get to level the playing field. Aviso allows you to level the playing field. It allows you to look across a massive amount of data and deducing at an organizational level—I'll say at the CRO level.\n\nThrough AI, producing an accurate set of predictions and insights that you can then confidently rely on to make guided selling direction and actions. I think today we just have way too much data for humans to be able to work with effectively and efficiently, and they're just signals in the data that are just missed.\n\nAnd I think Aviso helps to find, I like to say, diamonds in the data, and provide guided selling that you can then be confident are the right ones. To me, the accuracy of prediction that you can then rely upon builds confidence and trust. I see that that is what Aviso is maniacally focused on, which is one of the reasons why I've been part of the advisory team there.\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/xsHPVRt8O1s\"><img class=\"wp-image-9270 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Paul-Chapman-4_-Business-Resiliency.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: How to develop confidence beyond business continuity plans?</strong>\n\n<strong>Paul: </strong>I think we'll go back to what we mentioned earlier. When you think about legacy, and legacy ways of thinking, legacy ways of operating; if you haven't invested in modernizing your architecture and your services and the way that you operate, then you are now under extreme pressure to accelerate that digital agenda. And I think that includes the notion of what was more of a legacy way of operating, which was building a business continuity plan.\n\nAnd I've always found that business continuity plans are almost like the three-ring binder: here's our plan, we tabletop exercise what might happen if there was an earthquake on the West Coast of the United States and we lost power or a data center, or if there's an Eastern seaboard event that takes out…(a Hurricane Sandy sort of thing). But nothing really accounts for resiliency to a massive global disruption, which is what we're having now.\n\nAnd so, the switch from thinking about business continuity being this plan that you execute on, hopefully you never need it but if you do you have a plan that you can execute on, versus operating with business resiliency on an ongoing basis. I think now, this is proving out to be even more important because, without an effective therapy or vaccine over the next 9, 12, 18, 24 months, I think we could see rolling shutdowns happening on a frequent basis. We could see waves for the foreseeable future.\n\nSo how do we make sure that the next time this happens this is not an event, but it's business as usual or business as unusual depending on how we use that phrase? I think now is the time to push for investments in accelerating the digital architectures.\n\nInvesting in business resiliency so that our operations are resilient, our processes are resilient, our systems are resilient. It's somewhat business as usual when massive disruption happens. Of course, a lot of cloud services are built to be resilient—they have resiliency built in. They've always been sort of location agnostic.\n\nI always used to say, ‘work is a state of mind, not a place.’ Although these days, it is a place; it's our home environment. So, I would say that the way to think about this is: business resiliency is a way of operating on an ongoing basis versus business continuity is something that is preparing for an event to happen.\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/2aO_-q1a_nw\"><img class=\"wp-image-9271 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Paul-Chapman-5_-Company-Culture.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: How to adapt to work from anywhere?</strong>\n\n<strong>Paul: </strong>This is an extremely important topic because I think sometimes, we can get a bit consumed with technology conversations. But when you look at the culture and the emotional side of things, and the employee well-being side of things, some companies are nervous. They haven't grown up in what you would call a ‘work from anywhere’ style.\n\nAt Box, our ethos from day one has always been building environments that takes the work out of work, which allows for frictionless employee experiences to work from anywhere, any place, any time. That's been in our DNA from day one. And so, the environment is somewhat purpose-built for this type of situation. Some groups are more apt to transition than others. You can speed up some things but you cannot speed up the culture of work from anywhere.\n\nWhat could take, previously, several years to roll out at a comfortable pace, now, in certain investments in technology, are now forced into days and weeks. If you don't have a culture of adopting change at an accelerated pace or even just working in a different environment, that can be hard for a lot of organizations.\n\nI think if you pop it up a level from there and you just think about just leadership in general, this is a time to lead with empathy and compassion. It's crucial that we do that. It's key to be socially connected while physically distant from each other. We need to have open and intentional communication with our teams and our employees. We have to be thinking about employees that might be living alone.\n\nRemember to pay extra attention to people who may live alone or maybe a little bit more isolated. We have to do more emotional sharing. I've seen everything from the virtual coffee hours to taking meetings on Peloton bikes to cooking classes and yoga online. At Box, we have a wellness portal for fitness challenges, personal wellness goals, and health assessments. We use an app called Headspace, which is a mindfulness app. It helps with guided meditation and tips and practices on sleep and exercise and things like that.\n\nSo, no one's working 9-5 anymore. We've seen a flattening of the workday. We have a lot of data actually at Box that shows the usage of working patterns or how people are working.\n\nWe've seen a flattening of the working day where people are starting to work earlier in the day. Maybe that's because they don't have the drudge of the commute at the beginning or end of the day. We're seeing people work later in the day. We're seeing a softening around the middle of the day. I don't think there's going to be a single day where it's like okay, COVID is done.\n\nSo, we have to make sure that from a leadership and an empathy perspective, our message from day one was: we want our employees to take care of themselves, take care of their families, and then the work will take care of itself from there. So, definitely leading with empathy and thinking about the culture is extremely important at a time like this.\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/DhlHicOTrU0\"><img class=\"wp-image-9272 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Paul-Chapman-6_-Next-10-Years-of-SaaS.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: What are the new technologies you believe will be adopted in the next 10 years?</strong>\n\n<strong>Paul: </strong>I feel like a lot of the technologies that we need, or are going to need, are already in some fashion available to us today. Maybe a little more embryonic in others than other places. I think what will happen is not necessarily lots and lots of new technologies, but an acceleration of the adoption and the growth in the enhancements of capabilities of those technologies.\n\nSo, as an example, where you look at companies that provide simulation software for providing what feels like a conference room experience, whiteboarding, collaboration software, and things like that. Software that's been around for a while, but unless you have mass work remote may have been used marginally for some remotely distributed teams, unless you're already in it working as a remote organization.\n\nJust as a side note, I read a book this past weekend that was titled, “Remote: No Office Required” written by a gentleman by the name of Jason Fried. It was written in 2015, interestingly enough, and shared a lot of experiences about the value and the benefits of working remotely and some of the challenges and how to overcome those challenges.\n\nIt was almost like a prediction for what was going to happen in 2020. But what you see is people are now adopting tools and capabilities that they already had, but they're adopting them at a much more sophisticated level and an accelerated pace. I think it's like Zoom; it didn't get invented during COVID, it was around pre-COVID. Now we're seeing just a massive adoption there. We're seeing a lot of that.\n\nTo your point that we mentioned earlier around culture as well, I think we also have to make sure we focus on: business models are being disrupted, operations are being disrupted, technology architecture is being disrupted, and the culture of a lot of companies is being disrupted.\n\nYou mentioned the last 10 years, if you go back, I think statistics show or data shows that 55+% of the Fortune 500s have disappeared since the year 2000. Which if you do the math is more than one per month. When you look at ‘why?’, it was not because of technology. Technology was the enabler to the disruption, it was the enabler to the outcome.\n\nAnd that is now potentially being sped up even more with COVID. So, now COVID being the new champion of accelerating change or digital agenda for most companies. So, I think you're going to see a rise in software platforms that enable teams to collaborate better, simulate office experiences, whiteboarding, scrum meetings, software development, automated QA.\n\nI've been talking to some companies recently that are automating their security validations, compliance validation, automation of QA, bringing together in single dashboards for telemetry for what's going on across your organization, and measuring productivity. Things that are built for global teams to design, collaborate, and build more effectively. I think you're going to see a lot of things there.\n\nAnd of course, we're going to see a continued rise in leveraging machine learning and AI. I like to say that if any activity that takes a human being less than a second to think about can be automated. Doesn't mean to say it has been, but it can be. Think about the digital transients of today, versus the digital natives of today. They're entering the workforce with an entirely different set of expectations, a different way of working, a different way of thinking. They are much more apt to change and are not going to necessarily accept ways of working that were pre-COVID—things that are maybe standard, repeatable, mundane types of work.\n\nWe have to introduce digital labor, we have to introduce AI, we have to introduce machine learning. Otherwise, it's going to be really hard for us to even attract the new generation of workforce that's coming.\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/3l9OBPTQiC8\"><img class=\"wp-image-9273 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Paul-Chapman-7_-Best-Practices-for-CXOs.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: What advice do you have for new COVID hardened CXOs?</strong>\n\n<strong>Paul: </strong>Well, there's a lot packed into that question. You now have struck a new term for me here. We always talk about millennials as a generation: Gen Z, Gen Y, Gen X. Now we have maybe a COVID generation, post-COVID generation. It will be very interesting to see pre and post, whether or not we consider that a generation of workforce that went through this and what did we learn?\n\nI truly believe and this is one of the things that I really enjoy about the technology community or technology leadership community and more broadly, is the willingness to share and collaborate on feedback and learning and experiences which is the wisdom of our communities, how we all learn more. I often say the slowest rate of change we will ever experience is the one we are experiencing now.\n\nI think COVID is putting that to the test for sure. It's certainly not slowing down anytime soon. I often tell my organization; you have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. I often say; the pain of change is mandatory, it's the suffering that’s optional, and if you don't like change, you’ll like irrelevance even less.\n\nAnd I think as technology leaders, you have to reinvent yourself many times over to stay relevant and, in some ways, you're battle-tested for another transition here at an accelerated pace. I think that we will find that there are different ways of working more efficiently, more effectively. I've heard a lot of people saying that productivity has gone up in general for the most part.\n\nSometimes the work and personal sort of blends together a little bit. But people are generally feeling more productive. There are little things I just found out recently called ‘speedy meetings’, because meetings generally tend to start and end on time in this remote world that we're working in. As an example, I can disconnect from one Zoom meeting and immediately connect to the next one with no decompression time, just literally switch.\n\nContext switching is actually the harder part, not the technology, switching between meetings. There's this capability that’s called ‘speedy meetings’, whether you use Google for calendaring or Outlook, they both have this where anytime you set up a meeting for 30 minutes, the default changes it to 25 minutes. If you set up a meeting for 60 minutes, it sets it to 50 minutes.\n\nAnd because meetings generally are starting and ending on time, you don't have this five minutes in between meetings where people are running around buildings, going upstairs, elevators, running by the kitchen, grabbing something to eat, or whatever, and starting most meetings five minutes late.\n\nThis is actually allowing you to not only have meetings that are effective but also the playing field is being leveled in terms of an equalizer. Everybody is on the same platform. You don't have half the people dialing in to a meeting or video-ing in and half the people in the conference room.\n\nWe're finding that the participation of online and virtual, same with conferences, all-hands meetings, team meetings, one on one meetings, and the engagement has been significantly going up as well. We have to find ways to make sure that we do have these decompression times built into our working day. I think we're going to learn a lot of new and better ways to work that are in that area.",

		"content": "We recently had the opportunity to have a conversation with Henri Richard, a highly experienced technology executive. Henri was formerly an Executive Vice President of WW Field and Customer Operations at cloud services and data management company NetApp. Although Henri is now happily retired, his sales leadership life has not ended. He has most recently joined the Aviso Advisory Board to guide us on our digital disruption path. Below, you’ll find various video snippets and their transcriptions of our discussion with Mr. Richard. He shares the story of how he got to where he is today as well as various insights into dealing with the current global disruption we find ourselves in.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4Vn4wGUFoM&amp;list=PLz4ma-SOwEWyZQzG-XhSsRNbSYRwntPFx&amp;index=2&amp;t=16s\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9060 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Henri-R-Career-Video-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: You’ve been at the forefront of high-tech revenue leadership through your career. Can you share your journey? </strong>\n\n<strong>Henri:</strong> I started in this industry a little bit by mistake. Right after college, I started my own business. One day my chartered accountant, instead of bringing me a book, brought me a computer listing. I figured, oh, that's cool since I wanted to automate my entire business. So I contracted a company to write the software. They came to me and did a terrible job. And so overnight, I learned basic Applesoft and DOS 3.3 and I rewrote the application to my liking. The person that was running that company, of course, wanted to get paid for their work. And I refused to pay because I said, “You didn't do what I wanted.” And so, one day he was in my office and I showed him the rewritten software. And he said, “You know what? You don't have to pay me. Why don't you come work with me?” And that's how I ended up in the IT business. I developed a pretty large VAR business in France that I sold. And then I came to the US. My wife is American. I came to the US through one of the very hot startups at the time in the disk drive industry called Conner Peripherals. Conner got acquired by Seagate and I worked for Seagate for a while. Then I had the good fortune to join IBM to run their worldwide storage business, which allowed me to come and settle down in Silicon Valley.\n\nI then went on and worked as anyone at the time would do in the year 2000, with a software company, a startup called Webgain. We printed our S-1. We were ready to go public and then 9/11 happened and we never went public. So, I almost retired once already in my life. In the middle of selling the company, I basically got a call to go run sales at AMD. Those were the days where that was an up and coming company that was basically a consumer company trying to take on Intel. We had the good fortune to be first to market with 64-bit processor. And I had the good years where we really gave Intel a run for their money. I then wanted to get out of the PC business and broaden my expertise in other spaces. And so, an opportunity that was really interesting came up at Freescale Semiconductor, which was the spin out of Motorola semiconductor.\n\nAt the time it was held by a private equity. Company was in trouble. And I had the good fortune to join really at the bottom. And through hard work with the team, we were able to bring it back to the public markets in 2011. So, I spent almost 15 years working in Austin, always being based here in Silicon Valley. And I was tired of going back and forth to Austin on top of my 300,000 international miles. I decided to join SanDisk and I had a great run there running the non-retail part of the company, which is about 2/3 of it. And we sold the company to Western Digital. And at the time, I thought, okay, now I'm retiring. And in the midst of that sale, I got a phone call from a colleague of mine that had joined NetApp that asked me if I could come and help with the turnaround. And as you know, at the time, five years ago, NetApp was pretty much written off as one of the companies that was gonna go out of business. I enjoyed really working with George Kurian to turn things around and bring it to where it is today. But I had made it clear that I only had four years of runway. I'm retired, but as I promised myself as of the month of June (because I'm still in good health) I’m helping a few startups including Aviso. My corporate life is over, but not my intellectual and sales leadership life.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvOZqzdzzGU&amp;list=PLz4ma-SOwEWyZQzG-XhSsRNbSYRwntPFx&amp;index=3&amp;t=3s\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9061 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Henri-R-Why-Aviso-Advisor_-Video-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: What motivated you to join Aviso as an Advisor at this stage of its journey?</strong>\n\n<strong>Henri:</strong> Throughout my career, I've never worked with a CFO or CEO that wasn't unhappy with forecasting; t's always been a problem. I mean, first, you've got the uncertainty of the customers. I always reminded people that, “When was the last time you walked into a store and walked out with a different product than you thought you were gonna buy?” You know, customers have the right to make a choice and change their mind more often than not. So, to add to that uncertainty, which is inherent to any business, the lack of discipline, guidance and process that can exist in any sizable salesforce because it's very difficult to get a unit of behavior. It's been really something that's been with me throughout my entire career.\n\nIt was particularly getting critical as the recent crisis started to hit. And frankly, a lot of the existing models went through the window. And so right in the middle of me preparing my exit, frankly, I got exposed to the platform. I thought what Aviso was proposing in terms of the value proposition was spot on, enhanced by the COVID crisis. And then in parallel, I had started about a year and a half ago, a true virtual selling organization building inside NetApp, which had no inside sales and no virtual sales at all. And so, it was both timely because I wanted to empower this new salesforce with better tool, both the virtual salesforce and the field salesforce. But also, because I felt like COVID was gonna accelerate something that I've always thought was gonna happen, which is, I always said I'm an old guy, and anytime I can buy something on Amazon Prime, and not talk to a salesperson, I choose to. And so, to imagine that my personal life and my personal purchasing behavior will never come to my professional life is a mistake.\n\nYou become used to different types of interactions; you have different expectations in terms of the speed of an access to information. And so, I was always a proponent that virtual sales was gonna become a bigger part of the business. Now, little did I know that with COVID, we could actually prove that it could become the majority of the business. And that field sales can become a minority, an important contributor but a minority contributor. So, I was exposed to Aviso right in the throes of my exit. And of course, after leaving NetApp I was free to be an advisor, which I couldn't have been before. But I was sold on the platform, frankly, on the second presentation.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fOsg70vtUI&amp;list=PLz4ma-SOwEWyZQzG-XhSsRNbSYRwntPFx&amp;index=4&amp;t=3s\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9062 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Henri-R-Current-Disruption-Differs-Video-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: What feels different about the current disruption as compared to previous ones with regards to enterprise selling?</strong>\n\n<strong>Henri: I</strong> believe that there is something fundamentally different. And it's not gonna be in R&amp;D because let's face it, R&amp;D has been virtual for quite a bit of time. You could have an entire virtual R&amp;D team working from home. To a certain degree, finance, HR, legal, all of these functions were always able to develop tools and processes and work remotely. But somehow go-to-market, and sales in particular, seem to be the last fortress where you found a lot of people that told you that unless you can get in front of a customer, you can't complete a multi-million-dollar enterprise transaction. And so, I think that's the big change. I think that even the diehard old school salespeople that for the last few years were convinced that that particular aspect of the selling process would never change, have to take a step back and realize that that's not true anymore.\n\nI think that this crisis is creating a situation where you're gonna have winners and losers that are gonna be largely determined by the sales force leadership willingness to lean into the change. And I think that that's particularly exciting for Aviso because we can be an enabler of that change by limiting the downside risk of it, and really providing a level of intelligence that was never available before. I think the corollary is that I'm thinking of go-to-market as, in a lot of cases, largely still ZIP code coverage deployment models. Of course, everybody is trying to get away from the most basic aspect of that, but it still remains largely related to where you're physically located. And I believe that the super sales force of the future is one that we'll be able to combine for one particular deal, the best resources that exist across the globe, in the enterprise to go and put the best foot forward in front of a customer, hopefully get the PO.\n\nDisassemble that unit and reassemble another unit as quickly and fluidly as possible. Now, conceptually it's wonderful but it's difficult to implement. But I do believe that some companies are gonna be able to do that. They're gonna be able to change their business model from the go-to-market standpoint. And if you can be virtual, and on top of that, bring to each virtual sales unit the best talent that you have for that particular customer problem around the globe, then you have an incredible competitive advantage.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWCzSJfWjE4&amp;list=PLz4ma-SOwEWyZQzG-XhSsRNbSYRwntPFx&amp;index=5&amp;t=47s\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-9063\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Henri-R-What-if-you-had-Aviso-at-NetApp_Video-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: As a revenue leader of multi-billion dollar businesses like NetApp, how could Aviso help you on a daily basis?</strong>\n\n<strong>Henri:</strong> I'm not going to give you names in order to protect confidentiality but in one of my positions, I could have significantly affected the results of the company for the positive if I had simply taken the top 20% performers in my organization and replicated that behavior with the bottom 20%. And so, it was as simple as that. I didn't need more leads. I didn't need a better conversion rate. I didn't need to improve the size of my average PO. I mean, of course all of these things could have been helpful. But if I could have had the gross margin average on the deals of the worst sales guys that I had with the best sales guys for the same product, in the same type of transaction, in the same territory, or if I had the same closure rates, I would have changed completely the financials of the company.\n\nAnd so that's where I think our platform brings incredible value. Of course, it's good to be able to improve the predictability of forecast and have another way to go and do the analysis with the help of AI and ML of your pipeline. But I think that where the real incredible value that Aviso, used properly, brings to any organization, it's the guidance and coaching aspect. The automation of this replication of best behaviors, not in a punitive way, but in an encouraging way by showing people what to do and how to do it. And so, that to me is super exciting. And that's usually actually the angle that I take when I start to talk about Aviso with a prospect or a friend to get their interest deep.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHTx9vdyQsU&amp;list=PLz4ma-SOwEWyZQzG-XhSsRNbSYRwntPFx&amp;index=6&amp;t=2s\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-9064\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Henri-R-AI-Guidance-Video-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: How do you see the value of AI Guidance in helping improve productivity with both partners and channels?</strong>\n\n<strong>Henri:</strong> What's really always interesting with channels is that relative to vendors, they have to operate with lower gross margin and much lower operating expense, right? That's the nature of indirect sales. And so, if you think about it, their degrees of freedom and their ability to waste cycles is extremely limited. And therefore, the leverage of improving any sort of the ratios of closure or deal size or gross margin, any of those levers, are extraordinarily more powerful for the channel than they are for the vendor.\n\nThey're good for everybody. But when you start with 60%, gross margin, you have a lot more room for being sloppy than when you start with 15% gross margin. And so, I think that what this platform also affords any vendor that wants to turn it to the advantage of their channel is to give the channel partners, the same guidance in such a way that you would give the salespeople. In other words, giving them comparative of their behavior versus other channel partners. Of course, in all anonymity of the data and providing them with guidance as to how to make every bullet count when it comes to your franchise. And I think there's a double positive, it makes your franchise more successful. But also, as we know, partners go where the money goes. And so, if your franchise is much more profitable for them, then you'll probably get more cycles. And so that's an aspect of the platform, extending the value of the platform to the partners that I think has a lot of potential for the growth of Aviso.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYm8JU01x3I&amp;list=PLz4ma-SOwEWyZQzG-XhSsRNbSYRwntPFx&amp;index=7&amp;t=6s\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-9065\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Henri-R-Advice-for-CROs-Video-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: What is your advice for sales leaders and CROs on how they can survive and grow during this crisis?</strong>\n\n<strong>Henri:</strong> I am so happy to be retired. I can't even begin to tell you. Really, life is really great. But seriously, I think that the first thing that you have to do is always understand that. My motto has been when I wake up in the morning, there's someone in the world that's younger, smarter, faster, cheaper. They just didn't get this job. And so, you have to stay on your toes. You have to stay humble. You have to stay open to the fact that change is inherent, and that anybody that's trying to protect the status quo is really putting himself or herself in danger. That's for the people that think that after COVID things might come back to be the same. I have been blown away by some of the success stories in some of the new leaders and I'll give you a little story, an example.\n\nBecause I had the good fortune of being on a couple of the big consulting firm CSO boards. This particular sales organization and sales leader, whenever they have a Zoom meeting prepared with a prospect, find a way if possible, to understand whether they like alcohol or not. And then if they like alcohol, which sort of alcohol. And then they send pre-Zoom, a nice package that has a nice glass and a bottle of wine. And then on their side, they have the same glass and the same bottle of wine. And imagine, imagine if that works, right? Imagine the level of personal touch that this presents. And it's even interesting in the sense that you could never do this in the office. You could never have even if somebody says, “You know, I like red wine.” You wouldn't be able to bring a bottle of red wine at your first meeting in the office. But because the prospect is in their house, you’re home, it's an easy way to have a complete break-the-ice meeting.\n\nThere are countless stories like this. So, I think that the notion that virtual selling cannot close big transactions, the notion that virtual selling cannot create intimacy, the notion that virtual selling cannot create an enduring relationship. I think all of those are false notions. I think that there's gonna be a young generation of innovators, particularly in the go-to-market function that are gonna find a way to make the Zoom or WebEx or whichever platform you use, not only equivalent, but probably better than the previous mode of selling.\n\nLet's not forget that there are two forces at play that are probably irreversible. The first one is the power of the CFO. And I talked to a lot of CFOs. And I'm telling you, they're not ready to give back the T&amp;E budget that they've been able to claw back on the last few months. And if they give it back, they're gonna give it back with a haircut. And secondly, as we all squeezed for opex, the level of productivity that you can have as a salesperson, when you don't have to take a three-hour flight at the back of Southwest plane and then rent a car and get to… If you think about it, we should aspire to make virtual selling better than in-person selling. And we should reserve in-person selling to very, very specific use cases. But in my mind, virtual selling is the future for all of selling, not just for a certain type of transaction.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh7yj3WgaX0&amp;list=PLz4ma-SOwEWyZQzG-XhSsRNbSYRwntPFx&amp;index=8&amp;t=9s\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-9066\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Henri-R-Virtual-Digital-Selling-Video-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: How do you think about Virtual Digital Selling and its importance in this decade?</strong>\n\n<strong>Henri:</strong> I have been leaning into virtual selling and also zero-touch. I believe that before you go into a virtual selling, the success of a vendor these days is directly correlated to their online presence, the simplicity of accessing the information, the automated guidance that you can provide for a customer to make choices. So, for me, it starts with zero-touch, then it goes into virtual sales. And yes, I accept of course, that there are some situations where you'll have to send them to the SWAT team. But I think, in my mental model, I'd like to have 20% of the business pursued with zero-touch, about 60% of the business pursued virtually, and about 20% pursued in-person. And I think that we're gonna see in the next 36 months, the biggest transformation we've seen in go-to-market in a decade because of COVID.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxRlLnKuVqQ&amp;list=PLz4ma-SOwEWyZQzG-XhSsRNbSYRwntPFx&amp;index=10&amp;t=3s\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-9067\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Henri-R-Future-of-Sales-Enablement-and-GTM-teamsVideo-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: What do you think about the future of Sales Enablement and integrated GTM teams?</strong>\n\n<strong>Henri:</strong> Sales enablement tools are gonna become much more important for success than ever before. So, I think we're gonna see a lot of innovation in that domain. We're also gonna see a shift in budget to those tools, which is one of the other reasons I think Aviso is well poised for the future. Because some of the T&amp;E budgets, for example, could well be invested in IT systems to make the salesforce more productive and more intelligent about what's happening in the market. But back to your point of integration, of course, we used to be in a mode of big capex transaction where it was about catching the fish and then hoping that for three years nothing happens. Those days are gone.\n\nWith everything as a service, increasingly, and particularly with the cloud, gobbling up a lot of the IT budgets, selling is nothing. I mean getting the first PO is irrelevant. It's about customer success, the deployment of the product, the utilization of the product, and a virtuous circle of intelligence of what does the customer need? How are his needs or her needs evolving? And how can you accompany that evolution? And so, there's gonna be a shift in my mind from a lot of the stardom, and the money, and the drama being at the first transaction. In other words, gaining the customer. And that's shifting now to the right towards teams that are able to have excellent retention rates, great expansion of portfolio, and a loopback mechanism that brings back to the engineer the evolution of the needs of the customer. And so that's a very different model where in my mind product management, product marketing, field marketing, sales, technical support, professional services, all of these functions are gonna be redefined. And to your point, the boundaries are gonna change dramatically.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98Pc7UN2VxI&amp;list=PLz4ma-SOwEWyZQzG-XhSsRNbSYRwntPFx&amp;index=9&amp;t=7s\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-9068\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Henri-R-how-to-WFH-Video-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: What personal practices and tools are you using to stay productive during this pandemic time?</strong>\n\n<strong>Henri:</strong> Customers are always the priority. So, any topic that touches the customer gets the priority over anything else. But the way I’ve always managed my productivity is I use my inbox as my to do list. And my entire life, when I turned off the lights at night, I never had more than 24 emails in my inbox. I use a pretty robust set of automated management of the emails based on who sent it, what the topics and stuff like that.\n\nAnd really, for me, I always tried to be as real time as possible, prioritizing the customer. But I'm always amazed when I see people with 11,000 unopened emails in their inbox and wonder how they manage that? Maybe I'm too anal or into the details, but I would not be able to sleep if I didn't know that everything that's been communicated to me, right or wrong, important or not, I've been able to sift through it. Sort it out and extract from that the important messages that need an action from myself. And so that's been my discipline and even though I'm retired, I continue to do that. I guess I'll probably do it until I don't get any emails anymore. Because email will be obsolete. But that's been my discipline.",

		"content": "We recently had the opportunity to sit down with Will Anastas, a highly experienced Sales Executive. Will is currently Chief Revenue Officer at video optimization and analytics company Conviva. He also recently joined the Aviso Advisory Board. Below, you’ll find various video snippets and their transcriptions of our conversation with Mr. Anastas as he discusses various topics such as the value that AI can provide to sales teams and his advice to other CROs.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNDCfOBj7mo&amp;list=PLz4ma-SOwEWy8F0IH3QBccW6mkJoAl7Zb&amp;index=6&amp;t=114s\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9050 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Will-A-Career-Video-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: What are you working on now &amp; how did you get to where you are?</strong>\n\n<strong>Will:</strong> I was in sales really since I stepped out of college, for the most part. I did a little stint in politics and then moved into the sales world. My first management opportunity was actually with Anheuser-Busch, the beer company. That's really where I really got started in sales management. After that, I worked at a start-up in Boston called MediaMap, stayed there for about six years in sales management roles. Then went to Forrester where I got to experience a completely different dynamic because we weren't selling a product per se, we were selling really analysts minds, for the most part. Selling human intellect to do an engagement is very different from selling a product. We did have a syndicated product that we sold, which is the research that we publish through our website. But primarily the customers that we were engaged with were looking for very bespoke consulting engagement with the analyst community. It was definitely a shift moving from a product, a tangible item, to something that was somewhat intangible in terms of advice.\n\nWhen I went to Salesforce in late 2010, I literally thought the party was over. The company at that point had around 3,000 people, and had a really nice growth trajectory coming out of the downturn in 2008. They saw a flattening of their business for a year or so but then they were right back up and at it. That whole experience in Salesforce was incredibly transformative. You don't typically go from a company that has 3,100 people in it when you arrive, and then you leave seven years later, and it's 41,000 people. It was quite a dramatic change. I got to grow up in an environment that was constantly evolving and changing and adapting, and trying new things. What I loved about Salesforce is we could try different go-to-market strategies and see what worked. For me, it was just an amazing experience to have that type of autonomy to go and create new kinds of go-to-market models, but at the same time within a huge infrastructure that was being built around Salesforce and into the Salesforce economy. It was pretty amazing to live through. One thing I do remember is always interviewing, always hiring people. When I left my organization was about 350 people. So, it was a really, really large group. When I got there, it was 12. So, you just go through that kind of experience and it just changes your thinking and changes your mindset in terms of how to set up a sales organization. How do you optimize it? How do you use capacity modeling to understand exactly how to extract the revenue that you need in order to hit your number? It was just a phenomenal experience.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LaU6WNjULg&amp;list=PLz4ma-SOwEWy8F0IH3QBccW6mkJoAl7Zb&amp;index=5&amp;t=0s\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9051 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Will-A-Career-Video-thumbnail-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: Why did you join Aviso’s advisory board?</strong>\n\n<strong>Will:</strong> To be quite honest, while I was at Salesforce, I worked with Trevor who, as you know, is the current CEO. Trevor really taught me a lot and I also taught Trevor some things as well. We both developed a huge mutual respect for each other as we went through that process. When I was approached about Aviso, I was like, “Wow, this is some pretty cool tech.” When I looked at it for the first time, I was really kind of blown away with a lot of the promise that we were looking for. Even when we were doing forecasting and pipeline modeling at Salesforce, we just didn’t have this type of advanced technology at our fingertips, and we had some really good tech at Salesforce. For me, it was really excitement about the AI component and excitement about all the visualizations I could use and to see the pipeline dynamics. Frankly, I needed a really high-end forecasting tool. That’s where the product really came together for me. Once I saw it, I was like, “Wow, I really wanna be a part of this.” I was thrilled to be asked and I’m just honored to be on the advisory board.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwFiIhW_dWo&amp;list=PLz4ma-SOwEWy8F0IH3QBccW6mkJoAl7Zb&amp;index=4&amp;t=0s\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9052 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Will-A-Guided-Selling-Video-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: What are you most excited about regarding the value of AI providing guidance to sales teams?</strong>\n\n<strong>Will:</strong> My experience with AI really started when I was at Salesforce. I was part of a pilot team of leaders that were tapped on the shoulder to train Einstein, which is their AI application. We had a contest to see who would forecast better, Einstein or the human beings. Einstein won. That was like my aha moment that wow, artificial intelligence is pretty cool. I always had a hard time extrapolating out on November 1st what would happen on January 31st. Just that huge swath of time. Even though I had seven years of experience running this team and running this business, I was still off. Not by much, but enough that the AI component really, really did a better job than I did. That opened my eye to the power of AI once you train it and tune it properly, it can really be another marker for you as a leader to take a look at the number and say, “You know, this is what I think based on all of the historical contexts that I have running a sales team. Knowing all the personalities, knowing the sandbaggers, knowing the people who are inflating deals.”\n\nExtrapolating that all and then using actual intelligence, and trends, and AI to kind of wash all that out and come up with a number. To me it’s a really great marker. When I’m asked to do a forecast that’s 60, 90 days out, my first stop is to look at what the AI component is saying, Aviso. And then at least I have a marker to start from and build off of. As this system gets tuned and trained it’s just gonna become more and more accurate. The other parts I love about it is just the simplicity of the nudges to the reps themselves. Like nudging them to do certain tasks. For instance, data quality and data hygiene has gone up exponentially for us. Because people are being nudged to do certain things that they would normally, that they’re supposed to do but they will just forget to do because they got too busy. For me on the data consumption side of the equation, I’m the one who has to make sense of all of that data that lives inside of Salesforce, in our instance. I have to make sure that that data is accurate in order to get the right outputs from Aviso.\n\nIt’s all intertwined and interconnected and I think any sales leader is definitely banging their chest saying, “Hey, we need to have clean data. We need clean data.” Because if you have clean data you can make better decisions. If you make better decisions, you’ll have a better business on your hands. For me, that’s been a transformative moment taking a journey with the early days of AI at Salesforce and now seeing what it’s become four years later is absolutely amazing to me.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFyly5nbY1o&amp;list=PLz4ma-SOwEWy8F0IH3QBccW6mkJoAl7Zb&amp;index=3&amp;t=0s\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9053 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Will-A-Current-Crisis-Differs-Video-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: How does the current environment compare to previous downturns you have experienced?</strong>\n\n<strong>Will:</strong> I’ve lived through a few. 2001 was certainly a shock event. We had the World Trade Centre and the disaster around 911 and how that impacted business. At the time the economy was getting frothy anyway due to the dot com boom and bubble. But you know, those are moments in time that just happened and you knew, while you're in it, that things would get better, right?\n\nSo, there was some degree of certainty that this is just a normal economic cycle and these things happen and you know, people were saying just hang in there for a few years and things will get better. Same thing with 2008, right? I mean that destroyed the housing market and the banking sector took its licks on that one. But you knew that once you got the stimulus in the system and once all the governments pulled every lever, they could to get the economy going, you knew that that was something that was going to kind of solve itself. What's unique about this is the uncertainty around it, right? I'll be the first to admit when it first came down to me, I literally just got off a plane from London. By the end of the week, I was told not to come to work anymore. My kids were pulled out of school. The swiftness of the impact of COVID has been pretty amazing to watch. Now, I thought that Q2 would just be kind of like a lost quarter. We're just gonna have to trudge through it and see what happens and hope for the best. What I've learned and I learned this pretty quickly in early May, was that the degree of uncertainty in this environment today is prolonged. And for us as CROs, it's a really challenging time. We need to figure out exactly how we set ourselves up for the rest of the year. How do we do planning in 2021, in hopefully a post COVID world.\n\nWhat happens if it's not a post COVID world? What happens if we're still in it in 2021? Right? Now, all indicators say that vaccines may be available and things may be coming down. But this thing is so unpredictable. That unpredictability is really what's causing a tremendous amount of anxiety not only in the business community, but in society in general. Also the fact that it's global in nature. I mean, my APAC team is feeling it as just like my immediate team is feeling it. There are no pockets of health at the moment, which is very, very different than really anything I've experienced. And I think for us, we just need to really kind of sharpen our game. Make sure you kind of tackle and maintain the fundamentals of sales.\n\nUp your inspection of deals. Buying cycles have changed. Buying cycles have elongated. Buying decisions have gone up to the C-Suite as people hoard their cash. There's a lot of interesting market dynamics going on right now that you didn't necessarily see in those previous downturns. I think it's fueled by the uncertainty of what's going to happen in the future. I can't predict what's going to happen. I'm a glass half full person, just by nature. I'm hoping and praying that there's a vaccine and that that vaccine comes by the end of the year and that we all get inoculated and we just go on about our regular lives in 2021. I hope we can see an economic rebound in 2021. But then again, I was also hoping for this to be a quarter event and just a little hit in March. It's very difficult to predict the future on this one; that's what's causing a lot more anxiety than normal.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoFaeKbZmfQ&amp;list=PLz4ma-SOwEWy8F0IH3QBccW6mkJoAl7Zb&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9054 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Will-A-CRO-Advice-Video-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: What is your advice for CROs for driving growth in this new normal?</strong>\n\n<strong>Will:</strong> It goes back to making sure that the fundamentals are sound inside of your sales organization. If you don’t have good fundamentals, you’re not gonna have an opportunity to build upon them. If you continue to think of innovative ways to connect with your customers, think of innovative ways to prospect. This environment has become very, very difficult. But it's gonna take that innovation and as we think through different tactics on how to get people engaged, that's really what's gonna win. Just keep on iterating, keep on innovating, and seeing what works and like I've done a couple of pilot things in the past quarter just to see if they stick.\n\nSome of them have and some of them have just not worked. Take the ones that have worked, and you rinse and repeat those over and over again and then you discard those that don't. But that's not the end of the journey. You're always trying to innovate through this. Because, again, this is something we haven't seen before.\n\nYou know potential customers also are in the same boat as you are. So, leading with empathy at this moment we're all going through this shared collective global event is incredibly important. Those companies that are empathetic and flexible and listening to their customers, then those are the ones who are going to get paid back once this situation resolves. Those companies that are more strict on things and provide very little in flexibility, those brands are gonna get tarnished as we come out of this. Think of those innovative ways to help your customers through this because they're going through the same pain that you are in a lot of ways and I think those are the companies that are going to win.",

		"content": "As part of our ongoing interview series with industry experts, we recently had the opportunity to speak with Randall Runk, a highly experienced Strategy, Sales, and Operations executive. Randy was formerly a Senior Strategy Advisory at professional services giant Deloitte as well as a former Executive VP of WW Field Operations at cloud services and data management company NetApp. Randy also recently joined the Aviso Advisory Board.\n\nWhile speaking with Randall, we were curious to learn from his tremendous experience working at the forefront of various inflection points in the tech industry. Below, you’ll find various video snippets and their transcriptions of our conversation with Mr. Runk.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVOZhdLbw-4&amp;list=PLz4ma-SOwEWxknzuPM2x8W-LWejX_yBCB&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9038 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Randy-R-Career-Video-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: Can you give us an overview of your career journey?</strong>\n\n<strong>Randall:</strong> As you know, I started out at Pricewaterhouse. I was in the technology organization within Pricewaterhouse in a consulting group. During my career there, I pretty much specialized in large scale ERP implementation types of projects. If any of you remember the days of McCormack &amp; Dodge in MSA software, I actually began my career helping companies drive value out of those particular solutions. Ultimately, that morphed into the firm’s SAP and their Oracle practices. I ran the Oracle practice for PwC in the Americas.\n\nThat’s kind of what I found to be really interesting -- working with large multinational companies in addressing their technology frameworks to support the business and to really gain a lot of insight into some of the issues that companies have in terms of embracing technology. Also thinking that when they implemented technology, it was gonna solve all their problems. In most cases, it never solved all the problems and it probably was only a very small fraction of the problems. It was not the technology necessarily, it was really the processes that were enabled by technology, the data that was enabled by technology. Then the human element, the type of talent that you had in your company and how they exercised the use of the technology.\n\nIt was an interesting time of my career to see that and I think it framed my thinking in terms of even today how you use technology and where you apply it. How you provide care to whatever solutions you’ve implemented. That’s what my success as I transitioned out of consulting into running large scale sales organizations. It really created kind of the launch pad for me in terms of how I saw the elements of what my responsibilities as a sales leader were in how to address and transform these sales organizations to get a better result than they were getting before I was brought in to help do that transformation.\n\nWhen I left PwC and went to Oracle, the reason I was brought in was to provide a different type of selling motion into Fortune 500, Fortune 300 types of companies. And to get into more of a consulted type of sales motion as opposed to a feature-function sales motion which Oracle was historically been well known for being able to sell functions and features but pretty light on how they translated that into business value and how that may have impact on a company’s bottom line in terms of using the technology. There was a lot of selling of software based on the fact that it was cool and not necessarily on what drove the bottom line and what would really engage a CFO in a conversation around why it was important to make that kind of a huge investment. If you remember those ERP implementations, those were huge, huge projects. I had one that was a $100 million cost to the company that engaged us. They weren’t trivial and the companies were kind of betting their company on that software transformation and so it became really a key ingredient to be able to use a north star of business value and business outcome versus “Hey, I just got this software in and it works,” which is what had been done in the past. So anyway, the Oracle experience was really good. That led to me being recruited into HP by Mark Hurd.\n\nI ran the US sales organization for HP. Basically had everything in their portfolio with the exception of PCs and printers. Iid that for several years. When we acquired EDS, I was asked to go down there and be one of the four executives from HP to help bring EDS into the fold. I ran worldwide sales for that EDS organization and then subsequently, I spent a couple of years at Infor and then a year at NetApp. In all those roles it was basically running a multinational large-scale sales organization to sell software for and/or hardware.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2nToSikfak&amp;list=PLz4ma-SOwEWxknzuPM2x8W-LWejX_yBCB&amp;index=3&amp;t=5s\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9039 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Randy-R-Why-Aviso-Advisor_-Video-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: Why did you join Aviso’s advisory board?</strong>\n\n<strong>Randall:</strong> Number one, I have an incredible amount of respect for Trevor. Trevor worked for me at Oracle. He was one of the all-stars of the sales team at Oracle so I’ve always worked closely with him. I consider him a good friend in addition to my colleague. When I saw that he had joined Aviso as the CEO, I actually reached out and congratulated him. I thought it was a great move for him. He said, “Well, did you ever think about serving on a board?” And I said, “Well, interesting enough that’s really where I’m focused right now; it’s to join a few boards. This could be an ideal thing for me to connect with you over and if you want me, I’d be more than delighted to join as an Advisory Board member.”\n\nSo number one was Trevor and number two is that the artificial intelligence component of the Aviso solution is cutting edge. Sales leaders and sales executives are looking at different solutions that offer better predictability in the whole selling motion. There’s been a digital transformation in sales. Lots of technology thrown at the typical problems that sales executives have; territory management, opportunity management, contract management, all those types of things. Each one of those solutions, and there’s a myriad of them, all create data. The data becomes very difficult to get insight from regarding the implications from different sources and how that all comes together to help you create actionable plans that actually allow you to close deals.\n\nI see Aviso as the great solution to actually tackle the problem of information distortion that’s created by all those sources of data. How do you bring that together and provide insight to sales leaders and sales reps on how best to prosecute their deals in the most efficient and with the most efficacy that they can to basically provide more velocity from a deal from the beginning to the close? How do you get those things done quickly and how to get them done in a predictable manner. So that’s why I was pretty jazzed about when Trevor asked me if I’d like to join the board. I said, “Count me in. I think this is a fabulous solution and I wanna be part of it.”\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5i65vW-YSI&amp;list=PLz4ma-SOwEWxknzuPM2x8W-LWejX_yBCB&amp;index=4&amp;t=0s\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9040 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Randy-R-Guided-Selling-Video-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: How does AI give guidance to help teams close more deals?</strong>\n\n<strong>Randall:</strong> There are sales reps that are excellent and they have very good insight into their customers. They have good instincts for pressing a button to go after something and to take action or whatever. But, they’re probably less than 10% of the whole sales force. Then you have another large swath of sales reps, I’d say 80% of the sales reps. With them, they kinda get it and they kinda don’t get it. They’re always a day late and a dollar short in many cases on what should’ve been executed last week versus this week. Then you have another subset of 10% that just really doesn’t matter what you do with them, they’re not gonna be able to step up to what you wanna do.\n\nWhere Aviso fits into this is its ability to capture emails, to capture phone calls, to capture relevant metadata and detailed data around all the various interactions with a customer and also around the deal. To be able to put that in a form that provides alerts. It’s time to call on this client. You have an email that you were gonna meet with them on such and such a date.\n\nIn many cases reps will get lost in a deal because they have another big deal that came in. They ignore everything else that’s going on and they go after the big deal because they wanna get a close for the quarter. But they end up not meeting their quota.\n\nThe Aviso solution helps to keep that information front and center and helps the overall sales organization, the executives, product management, etc. to orchestrate a better interchange with that customer around a selling opportunity. That’s the real kind of the holy grail of selling is to have the knowledge so you know when to execute and when to pull the trigger on certain types of things that you’re trying to do with the customer.\n\nIt’s lassoing all that data and then converting it into actionable steps that the reps can use that to help them perform better. Their sales managers can use it to help know where to focus their time across the 7 to 10 reps that they might have under their organization. That’s where the value comes from Aviso.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrc-WzpFA8s&amp;list=PLz4ma-SOwEWxknzuPM2x8W-LWejX_yBCB&amp;index=6&amp;t=0s\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9041 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Randy-R-Advice-for-CROs-Video-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: What’s your advice for sales leaders and CROs on how they can manage culture friction while teams are WFH?</strong>\n\n<strong>Randall:</strong> Communication. Sales leaders have to get up and get out virtually with town halls. They have to take the time. I used to do all these town halls. Actually, I did them physically. Every time I did them, I would go, “Is this meaningful to the audience? Does it make sense?” Every time that I ask that question in small groups, people go, “We’d love to have executives speak out and continue to keep us up to date with where the company is headed.” It looks like there’s more transparency. You’ve removed fear from people. Sales people are always constantly in fear that they’re going to get fired because they are not making their quota or they didn’t hit the quota at the right time of the year and that kind of stuff.\n\nWhen you can give the organization a sense of comfort, then that organization will perform at a higher level. What I would recommend to a sales leader is to over communicate. If you think that you’re communicating more than you need to, you’re probably wrong. You could be communicating every day to different organizations and different audiences to keep people informed because informed employees they will really then focus on what their job is and get it done rather than spending half the day on the phone calling people. Did you hear this? Is this true? I think that executives have to step up to that and I think it’s all executives. It’s the CEO, it’s the CFO; the whole executive team has to be much more front and center in times like we have today.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8MHC438pHY&amp;list=PLz4ma-SOwEWxknzuPM2x8W-LWejX_yBCB&amp;index=7&amp;t=0s\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9043 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Randy-R-Evolving-Salesperson-Video-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: How do you see the function of the Salesperson evolve in the 2020s in regards to AI?</strong>\n\n<strong>Randall:</strong> Will sales reps be replaced by artificial intelligence in the selling process? I don’t think that ultimately there will just be a webstore and people will just buy off a store and we don’t need sales reps anymore, particularly in enterprise selling. You can do it with high-volume products but I don’t think you can do it with value products and services.\n\nWhen you’re a buyer, if you’re a CIO or an executive and you’re buying a tool for $10,000 you’ll probably buy it off a webstore. But if you’re gonna spend on something that’s gonna take millions of dollars of investment to operationalize and ultimately drive transformation to your company, you’re gonna want to have a conversation about it. You’re gonna want a series of presentations, justifications, analyses that support that if you do X, you’re gonna get Y and the confidence level that you’re gonna get Y is 95%. You’re gonna want to have that conversation with somebody across the table. The sales force will need to become more conversant in the value drivers of the companies that they’re calling upon.\n\nI’ve been a big advocate of industry selling. Meaning that if you’re gonna sell to a bank you better have a good understanding of how banks make money, what their business models are, and you can speak in the language of that industry and connect with that executive who’s gonna spend multi-million dollars on something. That you need to be able to talk that language. It’s going to even get more intense. You don’t only have to know the industry; you have to know the company because you have to know their culture. You need to know what their talent pools are like. The more sophisticated the rep, the more sophisticated dialogue and discussion that a rep can have is going to demand so that they become smarter about who their end customer is. If you go down that path, the days of a rep covering 20 accounts or 100 accounts are over. There’s just no way you’re going to be able to have any relevance to an end customer, if you just are tryna talk to 20 different customers across the globe or across whatever your territory is. If you take that line of thinking around knowing more about that company, all the data that gets created in that type of a sales motion, and again I think the AI components of Aviso hit that squarely in terms of how to get that data into a usable format.",

		"content": "We recently had the opportunity to sit down with Bill Heil, a highly experienced Operations and Technology executive. Bill was formerly President and COO of web conferencing giant WebEx as well as a former SVP of Operations at the cloud infrastructure company VMWare. Bill is now focused on providing his unique line of insight to high growth companies as an Advisor. He recently joined the Aviso Advisory Board.\n\nWhile speaking with Bill, we were interested in learning about his career trajectory and how he got to where he is today. We were curious to pick his brain regarding his tremendous experience with collaboration software and strong operations lens. Below, you’ll find various video snippets and their transcriptions of our conversation with Mr. Heil as he shares the importance of rethinking the norm to achieve revenue success.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vof-L_KVOs\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9022 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bill-Career-Video-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: What are you working on now &amp; how did you get to where you are?</strong>\n\n<strong>Bill:</strong> Right now I’m an investor and advisor with companies -- most of them are enterprise companies. I’m also serving on several non-profit boards. I’d say the one common thing about every group I’m dealing with today is that everybody is dealing with the current situation -- current uncertainty in economic times. So how do you help out non-profits? How do the technology and enterprise companies help customers? That’s kind of the theme. I started off my career as a product guy; I was a product manager. And I always looked at, and I still look at, IP.\n\nWhat’s super important to me is the company that’s investing heavily in technology. Look at the amazing technology transformations over the last 20, 30, 40 years in tech. One thing that was always common in all those environments, the company invests super heavily in sales, and super heavily in R&amp;D. Those groups got all the dough when it came to that. The thing that I noticed was that operations always kind of seemed to get the least amount of funding, the least amount of focus; the least amount of energy. So I decided to put my personal energy and time to work with business leaders, on the sales side and on the product side, to make sure that we always had the best people, the best systems, the best processes in place. It was really a simple idea yet it led to improving customer engagement, driving business, and reducing friction. I think this whole operations thing is a super interesting cultural part of a company. I always call the best operations people the operators of the business. And, to me, they’re the most important people. They work together as a team, they really make things work efficiently for the company effectively, and really help engagement with customers.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap4y_R8VCfc&amp;t=1s\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9024 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bill-Aviso-Board-Video-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: What motivated you to join Aviso as a Board Advisor?</strong>\n\n<strong>Bill:</strong> I joined Aviso in late 2019, before all of this pandemic and economic uncertainty. And I joined because of the people really. I was introduced by the CIO of Fox, a great business partner of mine, and a friend of mine, and he introduced me to the company. And Aviso is really a compelling place. I had known and met KV Rao a long time ago, and his great work, and his work with his Wall Street partner to bring this interesting kind of quant technology forward to the enterprise space. I thought that was an interesting idea. Then, I ran into my first meeting with Aviso with Trevor, and Trevor, that guy is amazing. Super smart guy, analytic -- he’s a big quant teddy bear. He’s super passionate. I don’t know many CEOs that are experts in game theory; not too many that I know. He’s got great passion. And he has tons of experience in the enterprise, so he knows the enterprise in and out. He knows SaaS in and out. He’s very philanthropically inclined. He’s a great guy, building a great team.\n\nI think Aviso is working on an important problem for the world, which is -- how do you drive economic productivity in the world? You do that by making the sales process better. Automating it, enriching it, using AI. I thought that was fantastic. And I think Aviso has some of the best AI tech around. Using AI to automate different processes seems like it’s a new thing in the last four to five years. People are using it in different ways in their companies. But KV and Ander were doing this eight years ago; eight or nine years ago they started out with this approach. I think they have done a terrific job.\n\nAviso has fantastic AI tech for the sales process. I think that’s great. I’m excited because customers like the product and get value, so that’s really an important test, to go, hey, are customers getting value? The ones that I’ve talked to Trevor and his team about are Dell, companies that people know, blue chip companies, Dell, MongoDB, Honeywell, Splunk, RingCentral, those kinds of companies. And it’s all about helping any kind of enterprise, whether you’re selling software, licenses, or renewals, support, services. But it’s helping those companies with the problems that they had before the pandemic, guidance, visibility. How do you sell more? Those kinds of things. I also like that the platform itself is a very interesting platform. I think it’s pretty quick to value. It can plug into all your systems that you have in your enterprise. It also pays for itself. You don’t need all of those CRM licenses, you can reduce that to help fund the platform. There’s a lot of promise of productivity tools for the last 35 years of enterprise space. There’s hundreds -- I saw some Gartner chart that must have had 400 CRM tools on it. But how many tools can you see that fund themselves, pay for themselves, and provide tremendous value to the company? So that’s really why joined -- I was driven by the people and the technology.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzq6LqzOb4Y&amp;t=3s\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9025 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bill-If-you-had-Aviso-Video-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: If you had Aviso when you were running high-growth businesses, how would it have helped you drive results?</strong>\n\n<strong>Bill:</strong> I’d ask -- how would the outcome have changed? I think you’d say, well, for sure it would have improved forecasting. But if you think about it, how is forecasting important to operators? It’s important to shareholders, they care about that. It’s important to people who have expectations. But you invest your resources in the company. Just a simple example of forecasting: depending on what the forecast says, you can invest more in R&amp;D, you can invest more in sales, you can invest more in remote locations, you can invest more in making your customer experience better. So just that simple thing is more efficiently investing. When I’ve worked at high growth companies, you never knew exactly what the growth rate is going to be, and you invested in some slightly more conservative way. Now, in sales, it would have changed everything.\n\nI’ve been through many different approaches to improve sales and sales productivity over many decades, so lots of things have been going on. But I have never seen this -- AI has a tremendous ability to sort out all the signals. There are so many signals in systems in a company. CRM kind of drove all of this, hey, let’s get all of these fields set up, and mostly it’s like an outbound reporting up to management of what’s kind of going on inside a company, and other parallelisms. But the AI can sort through this and say, hey guys, there’s five, eight, ten signals in your business that really drive what’s important. I think the AI can really spot things that the collective body of all of the operators in the company can’t figure out at a high level. They all know -- they’re all experts in their area, they’re experts in their signals of what works. In every dimension of a company’s workflow it would have got people to focus on what’s important. Every geo, every kind of channel. In the last company I worked with, at VMWare, we had every kind of channel. The end sales channel, renewal sales channel, services and report, direct, partner, all of those dimensions would have been helpful. I think it would have been super, super helpful, both in investing resources, and in improving sales velocity, and really simplifying what it takes to increase sales at a company.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-h-N_40pAo\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9026 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bill-Aviso-Current-Crisis-Different-Video-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: How does the current environment compare to previous downturns you have experienced?</strong>\n\n<strong>Bill:</strong> I think the single biggest thing is that this is global. If you think about the dimensions of this -- I’ve never experienced anything like this in my life, for sure. First of all, it’s all elements of people in your business. And who is that? That’s my employees, my customers, my shareholders, my partners, my supply chain. Everybody on Earth is affected by this thing. So that’s affected. So then if I’m building something that has any physical dimensions to it, any physical elements, all elements of my global supply chain have been disrupted somehow. So that’s like a stunning revelation for companies.\n\nPeople have been outsourcing more and more and more over the last -- decades and decades and decades, and they don’t realize how impacted their own supply chains are by global phenomenon. They didn’t build them to be resilient; they built them to be low cost, these supply chains. And then the third element is every single physical place you go has been affected on Earth, every building. Other than that, it’s just like every other downturn. It’s like there’s no baseline for the people that are running these companies today. They haven’t experienced this. I think everybody is reacting to this in their own way. How do you first start reengaging into this, and dealing with this pandemic?\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny-nF-fxmVQ\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9027 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bill-H-Tech-and-Collaboration-Video-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: What role does technology play in enabling collaboration and remote work in this new normal?</strong>\n\n<strong>Bill:</strong> The shift to remote work is really getting people to think substantially different. I think there’s probably a five year acceleration in people’s mindsets about several digital transformation processes, like commerce is different, supply chains are different. But collaboration is a lot different in 2020 than it was last year. This is what’s important to balance an enterprise -- do I have access to everything I need digitally to do my work? People say, okay, we’re getting systems in place to do that. Can I do that securely? -- that’s another important question. People don’t think about the security of files and things that are now in the workplace. The CIOs have spent decades making sure their on-premise enterprise centers are super, fantastically safe and secure. That’s different in the remote workspace. Make sure your collaboration tools all work with each other. The things that seem to have an advantage in this collaboration space are kind of open system, open software system things that work together. I’m a big, gigantic fan of Zoom; I think Zoom is a tremendous platform, a lot of people are using it. There’s other great collaboration platforms out there but they’re tied into important workflow things, like Slack and Microsoft Teams, and those things around the world. It’s very important to have integration.\n\nAnother dimension, if you’re thinking about remote work, is there are many elements of people’s business processes that aren’t digitized. If things aren’t digitized, it’s hard to deal with them remotely, from that standpoint. I’m super glad that the bandwidth of the internet is where it is today. If we had this pandemic seven to ten years ago, there’s no way there would have been video collaboration. I think there’s been this tremendous uptick of instant messaging globally in the last five years. WhatsApp is a phenomenon around the globe for instantly getting in touch with somebody, but what about video? Video is important to keep the connection with people remotely during all of this. In the early days of collaboration, it was about sharing a document. Now, the video collaboration is connecting with people. Face to face, let’s have a conversation. You and I are having a conversation now about what the future might look like, and what do we deal with? What are we dealing with with this pandemic? But this is a much different thing over IM, and it’s a much different thing over email, and it’s a much different kind of conversation over the phone. I think it’s lucky, in some sense, that the internet speeds and performance give high fidelity two way conversations, multi way conversations, with people these days, in the middle of all of this environment.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jccLBVh30KU&amp;t=6s\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9028 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bill-COO-CFO-Roles-Video-thumbnail-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: How do the roles of COOs and CFOs differ in today's world?</strong>\n\n<strong>Bill:</strong> I think they’ve totally changed already. I’ve spoken to a lot of CFOs and COOs at the start of the year. And take a typical CFO, what are they doing now? There are cash WarRooms all around the globe. Nobody knew what a cash WarRoom was six months ago. What do I do with my assets? Scenario plan is gigantic. Nobody knows what the outcomes are going to be. Nobody knows when things are going to reopen. Nobody knows when their supply chain is going to be back online. You can’t plan for it, but you can say -- here are three or four different options, and let’s make sure we’re prepared for them. Scenario planning is important. Communication too; I think the CFOs are being super, super, super thoughtful now about communicating in a consistent way and about how they’re thinking about the new world and this new environment. They’re all looking at their investments and thinking: “How’s my balance sheet doing? How’s my M&amp;A portfolio? Maybe it’s the time to buy some companies. Maybe it’s a good time to divest some things that aren’t so important to me.”\n\nI think CFOs are going through this very interesting time, where they’re really trying to help stabilize a ship moving forward in a sea of uncertainty. That’s their role. Now the COOs, they’re first noticing what this pandemic actually did. They’re thinking: “It disrupted my supply chain; I’d better work on that. It forced everybody to work from home. Oh, I’d better work on that. And it exposed all the places where I don’t have digitized processes in my company.” So I think the COOs are all around that whole thought process. How do you increase productivity through digital transformation? So there’s a great opportunity for COOs, for CIOs and business leaders to say, hey, we’ve found something wonky in our business. Maybe let’s take the sales process. And restarting that in our old normal way, the way we used to do business, isn’t appropriate anymore.\n\nMoving forward, in these different scenarios, it’s important we restart and think about how we can transform how we communicate with customers, how we help customers, how we can create resilience and reduce exposure to the business. They’re focused on the resiliency and stabilization of their operations. The more of a global company you are, the more issues you expose. I know I’ve talked to COOs that are now planning for 60% of their workforce -- and these are companies with tens of thousands of people, high tens of thousands -- to be remote when, before, it was in the 20% range. We’ve all heard stories of high tech companies saying, yeah, we’re going to have a 100% option for people to work remotely. So you have to think about what exactly is this global workforce? What does global work look like? What does remote work look like? In some sense, it’s a really exciting time. It’s high stress, I’m sure, for these folks, but it’s exciting that you can accelerate a place that you could have imagined your company being by five years. It’s like, yeah, I would have done it, it would have taken a long time, we would have used old processes. But people are getting a lot more clever about saying, hey, let’s do a little timeout here on this particular element of my business process, and look at how this could be totally different for our company and get us to the new normal. How can this get us to a place that’s stronger and more resilient?\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUmqlY4MhPo\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9029 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Bill-H-WFH-Tips-Video-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"896\" height=\"502\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Aviso: What has helped you stay productive while working from home?</strong>\n\n<strong>Bill:</strong> I think it’s important to have good meeting etiquette -- a basic, simple thing -- in conversations that you have with people online. And everybody is going through tens or dozens of meetings a day. It is super important to have a balance between work and life. I think everybody would agree with that. When I speak to people remotely on the phone now, I ask them how they’re doing. How are you doing? You talk to people that used to be working in call centers maybe for support on your internet or something, and now they’re working from home. How are they thinking about it? After talking to those folks, I’ve realized that I have to separate my work life and my life. That’s super important. Also, I’m involved in project work for nonprofits and with startups and I think having super clear is communications around a project is key. What are the goals we’re trying to achieve? What does accountability look like, and what are roles? It’s a simple thing, but there are a lot of newly formed digital collaboration tools. I get online with folks that are working on projects and talk about how Google Docs work and how we share it and those things, in a sharing sense of the world. But they know how they used to operate physically when they were working together in a conference room in a building, for example. You’ve got to stay healthy. You’ve got to stay focused on your health. So -- stay healthy, be positive and you’ll be ready for the next challenge that comes along.",

Aviso AI was recently featured in Selling Power's <a href=\"https://www.sellingpower.com/resources/2020/top-ai-solutions-for-sales\">Top 2020 AI Solutions</a>.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe year 2020 has already been a year of tumultuous twists and turns unlike anything we’ve seen in recent decades. It has brought concepts like “Black Swans” – unpredictable or unforeseen events, typically with extreme consequences – into the mainstream. Experts even say what we’ve just seen in the first half of 2020 may be the new norm for the decade: unpredictability.\n\nHere’s the truth: Surviving novel problems requires novel solutions. From a revenue perspective, old approaches, technologies, and biases won’t just hurt us – they have the potential to sink entire companies. If we learn the right business lessons from COVID-19, we can be better prepared for future uncertainty.\n\nUsing novel technologies such as AI will be absolutely key to remaining afloat through troubled waters. Here are three ways we believe AI can enable your selling success even through all-virtual WFH collaboration, deviant markets, and a general mood of chaos.\n\n<strong>1. Stay close to the ground with AI understanding of markets and buyer behavior.</strong>\n\nCompanies can benefit from applying the power of AI both to who they sell to and how they sell. Leaving this sensemaking task to human brains is fraught with specific risks – humans don’t look far back enough, broadly enough, or objectively enough.\n\nA starting point with AI can be looking at similar challenges experienced in the past, and how revenue forecasts dropped in those situations – for example, previous recessions. At Aviso our AI Research team has found that the extent of the impact your industry faces depends on a variety of factors: financial resilience, sales cycles, geographical exposure, churn versus new customer acquisition rates, account sizes. All these considerations should be modeled into your business to forecast future quarters.\n\nOn the buyer engagement side, AI can also help you develop more empathy for the impact on prospects so you can adapt the way you sell. For example, applying AI to actual email and calendar engagement – and even chat conversations – will give your sales teams a better understanding of prospects’ pain points and how to create a virtuous cycle with them.\n\n<strong>2. Collaborate as one virtual team with revenue-focused AI “war rooms.”</strong>\n\nWorking from home is the new normal. From team SKOs, on-site demos, and field sales, revenue teams are rapidly digitizing all their operations. How do you keep up velocity virtually? In times of rapid change, just “watercooler” collaboration (e.g., Slack or Zoom) is not enough. During remote work, teams suffer from deeper cognitive biases. Good news looks better than it should, and bad news often doesn’t enter the discussion. These biases can compound and spread across CRM, forecast calls, and deal reviews, and inhibit timely actions.\n\nWe recommend using digital “revenue war rooms” where sales leaders and teams can plan and execute during these uncertain times. Ideally, these rooms combine the best of Zoom, Slack, and CRM-like tools while keeping end-to-end encryption and also augmenting sales collaboration with AI insights, live chat, video, file sharing, and “to-dos” prioritization.\n\nSuch rooms serve as a virtual collaboration space to move deals – drawing in other go- to-market members such as customer success, marketing, or legal, for help when needed.\n\n<strong>3. Vigilantly apply AI to predict forecasts and recalibrate pipeline numbers.</strong>\n\nA key challenge faced by companies in crises is that CRM data loses its trustworthiness. This is due to many deals drying up as poor economic conditions lower buyer intent. CRM becomes a lagging indicator of business. More so, if you are using a spreadsheet, it is nearly impossible to forecast during COVID-19 due to the large amount of rapidly shifting variables constantly influencing potential revenue outcomes.\n\nRe-assessing both forecasting strategy and pipeline quality is critical to revenue success. Using a machine learning approach to forecasting sales – preferably with a tool that applies advanced data science to learn your organization’s selling patterns – will help your team get smarter over time. AI pipeline analytics can help with objective, unbiased inspection.\n\nComparing start-of-the-quarter pipeline and new pipeline added to ending pipeline predictions can reveal when and where you need to strengthen revenue strategy. Playing the long-term optimization game is key to sustained revenue; see if you’re on track to creating sufficient pipeline one, two, and three quarters out. To round the process out, find out if your pipeline is the optimal mix of opportunities that will gear your team for success.\n\n<strong>Confidently close your next quarter with an AI Guidance Compass</strong>\n\nAviso is here to help companies recover from the impact of COVID-19. Get Aviso AI complimentary for 90 days to understand your business better, collaborate more effectively across your revenue team, drive more revenue, and reduce the burden of CRM.",

We were interested in learning about Ken’s career trajectory as well as his unique experience with using advanced technologies like Auto-Machine Learning in the sales field. Formerly CRO at Silver Peak and Global Head of IoT Sales at Cisco, Ken brings a seasoned perspective to the table when dealing with all things sales, revenue, and internet technology. Below, you’ll find snippets of our conversation with Mr. Laversin as he delves into the importance of digital transformation to achieve revenue success.</span>\n\n<strong>How can AI like Aviso help close more deals and give guidance on deals?</strong>\n\nIn this video, Ken discusses how Managers can guide Sales Reps with strategies from AI insights. Such strategies include analyzing reps activity on CRM, email, calendar, and phone to optimize performance. This type of AI will help sales leaders better predict revenue as well as to better coach their teams to get deals closed sooner.\n\n<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/421973448\"><img class=\" wp-image-8800 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Frame-11.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"641\" height=\"360\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>What did Aviso do better to stand out and meet your needs at Silver Peak?</strong>\n\nWhen buying mission critical software, it’s key that the team you’re purchasing from tailors the platform to your requirements. In this clip, Ken discussed how Aviso met the needs of Silver Peak’s specific business requirements when being on-boarded and throughout the whole process. This was very important at Silver Peak due to their unique revenue stream model, which is very different from your standard software company.\n\n<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/421973221\"><img class=\" wp-image-8803 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kl-video-2-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"639\" height=\"359\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>How does Aviso help CROs like you attain predictable business outcomes?</strong>\n\nKen wasn’t initially a true believer that AI technology would be able to accurately forecast revenue. But over time, he realized that Aviso's predictive forecasting was consistently within 3-4% of where they ended up at EOQ. Hear from Ken on how predictive forecasting enabled ultimate visibility into his channel-partner revenue model at Silver Peak.\n\n<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/421972939\"><img class=\" wp-image-8805 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kl-video-3-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"638\" height=\"357\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Can you share your sales journey from inside sales rep to successful CRO?</strong>\n\nIn this video, Ken talks about how he worked way up from being an SDR at Siebel to CRO at Silver Peak. Learn about his career journey here.\n\n<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/421972619\"><img class=\" wp-image-8806 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kl-video-4-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"638\" height=\"357\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>What is your advice for sales reps just starting their career journey?</strong>\n\nIn this clip, hear about Ken’s life mantra and his advice to young sales professionals. Ken's advice is to the point: if you're a sales rep just starting off, it's imperative to know that nobody’s going to give you a list of leads that are going to turn into pure gold revenue. You need to get out there and hustle, work hard, network, and build your personal brand.\n\n<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/421972346\"><img class=\"wp-image-8807 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kl-video-5-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"638\" height=\"358\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>At Silver Peak, how did you manage your day with Aviso and other tools?</strong>\n\nAs CRO, Ken started every morning looking at sales forecasts on Aviso AI. He asks himself key questions like: Has revenue prediction gone up or down? Which deals have moved? Which deal probabilities have changed? Ken advises using this critical information to get your team moving in the right direction for the day. Learn more about this and how revenue is a lagging indicator of sales success in this video.\n\n<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/421971892\"><img class=\" wp-image-8808 aligncenter\" style=\"color: #456381;\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kl-video-6-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"641\" height=\"358\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAside from his experience managing large revenue teams and scaling sales at various organizations, Ken most recently find himself as a member of the Aviso Advisory Board.

Rather, it is a peek into our experience of how to run an entire business remotely during a crisis, using our own tool. In this blog post we share how Aviso’s platform has helped us manage during this crisis period.\n\nPandemic time is unlike anything we’ve seen. It isn’t just about Working from Home (WFH) as a team; it is about Working from Home during a Pandemic (WFHDP), an entirely different issue.\n\nWe’re now living in a default-digital society, the strength of which depends on our ability to maintain communication in a different way than pre-pandemic times when more often than not, you could simply walk over to a person in an office and resolve an issue.\n\nBeyond just video and messaging for water-cooler conversations, we need new tools that can help us deal with the intensity of 100% remote work while all companies deal with the same.\n\nPurpose-built tools can mitigate risk and maintain our working flow amidst external chaos.\n\nUsing the Aviso platform - including our new beta features - has been crucial to our continued success in collaboration, visibility, and accountability to our goals, and team-specific actions.\n\n<strong>How Aviso uses Aviso to integrate GTM and Product  </strong>\n\nWe aspire to a 1Aviso philosophy, where Sales, Marketing, Customer Success, Product, Data Science, Design, QA teams, as well as our external agencies and partners all work towards a 1Aviso common goal of serving our customers better.\n\n<strong>Sales Team</strong>\n\nJust like other sales teams, our global sales team relies on lots of data collection and analysis to make better decisions about turning prospects into customers and growing our accounts. They also rely extensively on collaboration with other team members to succeed. Their success depends on accurately forecasting their number and managing deals in play with speed and rigor. We do this with our own instance of Aviso AI.\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-8760 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CollaborationPg_Forecast-Room-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"507\" height=\"349\" />\n\nHere are just three ways our sales team uses Aviso:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Monday morning forecast calls with Aviso Forecasting help us understand how we are tracking week over week towards our targets and gives visibility and transparency across the entire sales pipeline and so we can take action early in the quarter.</li>\n \t<li>Weekly deal reviews between managers and reps to investigate specific activity within deals with Aviso Activity Intelligence. Managers boost lower-performing reps with insights into the behaviors of top performers.</li>\n \t<li>Timely email and mobile nudges to deliver insights that can be acted upon immediately</li>\n</ul>\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-8761 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/forecasting_One-team-Forecasting.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"589\" height=\"345\" /><strong>Marketing Team</strong>\n\nOur marketing team uses tools like Aviso to communicate faster, compress hierarchies, and maintain transparency. Our success is dependent on our ability to collaborate across content, demand, and design efforts virtually. Using the Aviso platform has been important in their ability to strategize, write, implement, design, communicate, and move quickly together.\n\n<img class=\"wp-image-8763 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pipeline_Pipeline-health.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"607\" height=\"383\" />\n\nHere are the areas in which using the Aviso platform is essential for our marketing team:\n<ul>\n \t<li>With global demand sinking due to the crisis, rebuilding lost pipelines is of incredible importance to marketing. More advanced AI features like pipeline analytics provide insight into the strength of the funnel while relationship intelligence aids ABM efforts.</li>\n \t<li>With CRM updates being less reliable than usual during the pandemic, email and calendar activities are good leading indicators of actual deal activity. Marketing and Sales Operations use Aviso’s Activity &amp; Relationship Intelligence capabilities to evaluate and support deal engagement.<img class=\"size-full wp-image-8764 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Deal-Guidance_Activity-Relationship.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"613\" height=\"365\" /></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Customer Success Team</strong>\n\nOur customer success team needs software to enable remote communication with customers, internal teams, and company stakeholders. Their success is dependent on quick response time, insights into customer issues, and the ability to increase adoption and retention rates.\n\n<img class=\"wp-image-8765 aligncenter\" style=\"color: #757575;\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/aviso-on-aviso.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"521\" height=\"310\" />\n\nHere are some ways the Aviso platform helps our customer success team:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Resolving customer issues and driving product adoption is made easy with collaboration features such as chat, video, screen sharing, and file sharing and annotating. Rich conversation streams between customers and customer success become much easier.</li>\n \t<li>Customer support in real time is enabled through real-time collaboration internally between support engineers, data scientists, and customer success teams.</li>\n \t<li>Chat, video chat, and screen sharing are used for replicating in-person collaboration efforts.

Yes, in a world of free Zoom and Slack accounts, it may seem counter-intuitive to seek out additional tools or capabilities. However, at Aviso AI, sales and deal collaboration is <em>a lot</em> more than just live meetings and chat.\n\nAt its simplest, virtual collaboration is communication between parties. At its finest, virtual collaboration is an intricate web of signaling between team members, external agencies, stakeholders, and customers in order to achieve goals. At Aviso AI, we never underestimate the power of a tool to enable such intricacies.\n\nWhether to frame team strategy around a stalled deal, communicate insights between managers and reps, or pull in “Go-to-Market” team members from Marketing and Customer Success to Legal and Procurement, effective and rapid collaboration in Sales can make the difference between beating the number or getting beat.\n\nAviso is happy to announce the release of AI-powered Digital WarRooms into our platform. Such WarRooms optimize the possibilities for virtual sales team collaboration through AI deal insights, SmartTranscripts of meetings and forecast calls, and surfaced rep activity intelligence. Read on to find out how we leverage artificial intelligence to supercharge collaboration on all levels of the revenue cycle.\n\n<strong>Deal Rooms:</strong>\n\nAviso Deal Rooms are a unified location for all deal-specific conversations, strategies, and assets. Deal rooms are a place for sales and other team members working on a specific account to have conversations in the context of that deal with key information and AI insights alongside. Now every opportunity in Aviso comes embedded with its own collaboration space, that administrators or deal owners can activate in one click.\n\n<img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-8709\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Cross_function_img@1x-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1316\" height=\"994\" />The insights panel present in-room surfaces deal-specific insights such as:\n<ul>\n \t<li>WinScore showing the probability of the deal closing in the quarter</li>\n \t<li>Factors affecting whether the deal will close</li>\n \t<li>How much discount to offer a customer</li>\n \t<li>When the deal will close</li>\n \t<li>Which products should be recommended</li>\n</ul>\nWith Deal Rooms, sales organizations can stay in the loop about the latest conversations going on surrounding deal activity. On a week-over-week basis, the deal rooms also contain an archive of forecast and deal review calls, with an archive of all recordings transcribed by AI. Through this emerges increased transparency, proactivity, and better teamwork.\n\nDeal Rooms can also contain all deal-specific assets organized and are accessible by all members of the rooms. These assets can include Statements of Work, marketing collateral, NDAs, Close Plans, or Campaign or Engagement Plans. It additionally includes different document types including notes, screenshots, audio, video clips, and other files related to the deal. These assets can be organized into folders for easy access.\n\nFinally, Aviso users can utilize the To-Do’s feature to keep on top of action items that need to be completed related to the deal. Team members can assign them to themselves or other members of the deal team. Productivity and accountability on an individual and team level is maximized and deals move faster.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Forecast Rooms:</strong>\n\nAviso’s Forecast Rooms are purpose built spaces to help Operations, Strategy, and Field team members align around Monday morning forecasts and weekly deal reviews. In Forecast rooms, teams can access forecast related AI insights specific to regional, product, or other business pivots. These rooms can be used by all organization members for ad-hoc discussions about any given topic with the same collaboration functionality as deal rooms. Users can create rooms between sales managers and marketing or customer success team members to discuss customer renewals and up-sells. Managers can also use these WarRooms to coach their reps on how next steps to better performance with the help of rep activity intelligence.\n<p style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-8711\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Coach_img@1x-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1316\" height=\"993\" />Forecast rooms contain the same collaborative features as Deal Rooms. The newest updates to this feature set include SmartTranscriptions, where team members can review Natural Language Processing derived transcriptions and meeting highlights from forecast calls.</p>\nDigital WarRooms empower sales teams with the power of AI collaboration spaces, bringing the best of tools like Slack, Zoom, and Chatter, helping revenue leaders get a birds’ eye view across all deals, and go-to-market teams grow pipeline and revenue faster.

		"content": "<a href=\"https://info.aviso.com/reduce-covid-19-revenue-risk\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-9004\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Banner-for-Blog2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"867\" height=\"200\" /> </a>\n\n<em>If you would like to read this content in PDF form, download <a href=\"https://info.aviso.com/combat-covid-impact-with-predictive-ai\">here</a>. </em>\n\nThe numbers keep coming in and they’re not looking good. Over 22 Million American jobs lost. GDP contraction of over nearly 5%. Social distancing extended.\n\nHow can CEOs and CROs manage revenue risk and recalibrate sales strategy in the face of this unforeseen market turmoil? Bain Consulting recently <a href=\"https://info.aviso.com/reduce-covid-19-revenue-risk\">released a detailed report</a> on how to do so titled <em>“Preserving Revenues in B2B Markets as Covid-19 Spreads”</em> where they say:\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“Executives responsible for revenue—CEOs, GMs, and heads of sales—must act decisively to soften the blow and adjust to uncertain times. While no one can precisely predict the longer-term effects of this crisis, we do know that earlier 2020 sales forecasts are now obsolete.”</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>- Bain &amp; Co.</em></p>\nBain then points out 5 specific problems and solutions to these problems. But how do you apply these principles in action? This is where Artificial Intelligence can help.\n\nThe famous American fighter pilot John Boyd once said:\n<blockquote><strong>“Whoever can handle the quickest rate of change is the one who survives.”</strong></blockquote>\nTaking smart actions now with Artificial Intelligence can help you prepare better. Building on Bain research, we’ve created a guide to help you come out of this crisis with strength using the power of Predictive Artificial Intelligence.\n<h3><img class=\"size-full wp-image-8439 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Prob-V-Solution-Bain.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"539\" height=\"275\" /><strong>I. Teams Misaligned and Lost? Use Revenue Winrooms.</strong></h3>\nWorking from home is the new normal. From team SKO’s, on-site demos, and field sales, revenue teams have moved all operations online. How do you keep up velocity and success virtually? Bain &amp; Co. advocates for setting up revenue “winrooms” where sales leaders can plan and execute on revenue preservation during these uncertain times.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“A win room serves as a clearinghouse to absorb analysis, add real-time intelligence from the field, rapidly deploy &amp; reorient people to critical areas. Companies can also use the win room as a laboratory to see what works best”</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>- Bain &amp; Co.</em></p>\nSuch winrooms serve as a virtual collaboration space to track deal activity, drawing in other Go to Market members beyond Sales, such as Customer Success, Marketing, or Legal, for help when needed, and ensuring no deals that are on track for success slip up.\n\nAviso helps with this through AI powered deal, forecast, and collaboration rooms in the form of an <strong>integrated workspace.</strong> These rooms bring the best of Zoom, Slack, and Chatter like tools while keeping end-to-end encryption and also augmenting the collaboration experience with AI insights alongside. They also involve collaboration tools such as live chat, live video, file-sharing, and ‘To-Dos’ message prioritization.\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-8440 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-15.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"392\" height=\"277\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-8442 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-16.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"265\" />\n\nHowever, in times of rapid change, just digital collaboration is not enough. During remote work, teams suffer from deeper cognitive biases. Good news looks better than it should and bad news often doesn’t enter a discussion unless someone brings it up. These biases can compound and spread across CRM, forecast calls &amp; deal reviews, and follow up actions.\n\nTake CRM, where reps may enter overly optimistic numbers. In forecast calls, managers may choose to only talk about “safe deals.” And in daily actions, reps may choose to communicate with prospects who are friendly but aren’t equipped with decision making power, versus prospects with the highest propensity to help close a deal. This is where advanced AI based transcription, manager-rep coaching, and deal actions come into play.\n\nAviso Smart Transcription uses NLP to summarize and generate highlights of forecast calls and deal reviews, with AI insights into areas of concern, and post-call summary and actions.\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-8443 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-17.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"273\" height=\"243\" />\n\nHaving advanced digital collaboration tools to align Go-to-Market team members and recording all conversations adds a strong layer of vigilance into GTM team activities.\n\nIn addition, Aviso can also help measure how actual sales rep activities including emails, calendar meetings, and phone calls to prospects are being executed on the ground.\n\nAviso Activity Intelligence and Relationship Maps bridge the gap between deal actions and results. They help deep dive into individual deals to see deal history, scheduled meetings, most and least engaged contacts, contact relationship map, and deal interactions over time. Aviso’s time-series database allows us to then look at rep and team activity as additional leading indicators to help both improve forecast accuracy and deal guidance.\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-8444 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-18.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"407\" height=\"278\" />\n<h3><strong>II. Past Trends &amp; Data Irrelevant? Use Predictive AI Forecasting.</strong></h3>\nWith COVID-19, previously done revenue forecasts are now unreliable and need to be recalculated to include the changes and impacts this global crisis has brought.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“Sales forecasts for 2020 just became obsolete. Commercial organizations must reassess expected revenues under a much broader range of scenarios.\"</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">- Bain &amp; Co.</p>\n</blockquote>\nYour forecasting reassessment shouldn’t be on an Excel or Google spreadsheet. With that approach, it would be nearly impossible to forecast during COVID-19 due to the large amount of rapidly shifting variables constantly influencing potential revenue outcomes.\n\nThis is where predictive analytics rules. According to a report Bain released late last year,\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“traditional pipeline management relies heavily on the sales rep’s input...by contrast, analytics-based pipeline scoring applications such as Aviso can independently assess the probability that a deal will close based on modeling the attributes of comparable past deals won or lost.”</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>- Bain &amp; Co.</em></p>\nAviso’s AI team has recalibrated AI forecasting scores to take into account pandemic changes and trends to help you reassess forecasts including multiple new indicators.\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-8445 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-19.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"377\" height=\"280\" />\n<h3><strong>III. Recalibrating Revenue Source? Use Surge, Secure, At-Risk.</strong></h3>\nJust like your past aggregate forecasts were thrown out the window, deal-level predictions are similarly at risk. Taking time to scrutinize the deals in your pipeline based on the following methodology will be crucial to efficient deal execution.\n\nBain has a 3 part strategy for safety &amp; survival:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Surge for products that now might be in higher demand.</strong> For e.g. if you are an industrials company, Humidifiers may be in greater demand through the rest of 2020 versus only in seasonal demand.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Secure for solid revenue such as contractual subscriptions from longtime customers.</strong> For e.g. your top 2 customers may all be in Healthcare and may still be open to multi-year contracts, so you could lock in more solid revenue with them.</li>\n \t<li><strong>At-Risk for commitment and consistency, but no contract.</strong> For e.g. your Central US sales leader may be committing 7 deals with 90% probability of winning in your CRM, but no conversations have happened on 3 of those deals since COVID-19 started.</li>\n</ol>\nAI based deal maps can help with Surge, Secure, and protecting At-risk deals. One of the outputs of predictive analytics we generate at Aviso is a Deals Map. The 4 quadrants of the map correlate to the Bain methodology provides reassessing anticipated revenue.\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Surge → Upside Deals.</strong> These are deals that are currently not in your forecast but which our AI models identify as highly likely to close if pursued.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Secure →  Deals in Focus.</strong> These are deals that are in your forecast and our AI models agree that they should be there.</li>\n \t<li><strong>At-Risk →  Deals at Risk.</strong> These deals are in your forecast but our AI models have flagged them as not likely to close. We suggest you remove them from forecast.</li>\n</ol>\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-8447 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-21.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"389\" height=\"274\" />\n<h3><strong>IV. Suspect Pipeline? Use AI to Find New Pipe and Convert Better.</strong></h3>\nCOVID-19 has induced a unique market in which classic recessionary issues relating to liquidity and capital have extended to the consumer economy. Social distancing has disrupted labor participation and productivity growth.\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-8448 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-22.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"248\" height=\"233\" />\n\nAs a result, buyers are re-evaluating their purchasing intent in light of budget cuts or uncertainty and pipeline reports are no longer accurate. Bain recommends inspecting your entire pipeline to keep the most critical deals moving forward.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“Adjust pipeline percentages and run scenarios with more divergent outcomes. After all, an opportunity with 80% probability remains $0 until it converts.”</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>- Bain and Co.</em></p>\nAI based pipeline analytics can help with objective, unbiased inspection. Comparing start of the quarter pipeline and new pipeline added to ending pipeline predictions can reveal when and where you need to strength revenue strategy.\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-8449 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-23.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"444\" height=\"262\" />\n\nUse Aviso to inspect the pipeline of future quarters with advanced pipeline analytics. Playing the long term optimization game is key to sustained revenue; see if you’re on track to creating sufficient pipeline one, two, and three quarters out. To round the process out, find out if your pipeline is the optimal mix of opportunities that will gear your team for success.\n\n<img class=\" wp-image-8450 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-24.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"370\" height=\"216\" />\n\n<img class=\" wp-image-8451 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-25.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"378\" height=\"249\" />\n<h3><strong>V. Haywire Spending? Draw an Objective Spend Map.</strong></h3>\nBain recommends mapping out your target market’s spend on good and services in your industry to better understand\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>“Create a map of how much each customer spends in your market, and open opportunities to capture more of that spending.”</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>- Bain and Co.</em></p>\nTo make this technique more effective, we suggest making a spending map of your own organization. Doing an audit of software licenses, for example, typically reveals a surprising amount of unuse. A silver lining of a major system shock like this one is the opportunity to reduce internal spending on unused, out of date software. As a case study, take a look at this spread of the top spending by category of sales and marketing technology:\n\n<img class=\" wp-image-8452 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-26.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"375\" height=\"225\" />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Source: https://zylo.com/blog/saas-spending-trends-vs-expenditures/</em></p>\nOur research shows that cutting CRM usage and cost analysis can help optimize spend reduction by 20-30%. Eliminating non-essential licenses can immediately aid this effort. These users -- usually found on Procurement, Legal, Operations, and Leadership -- only use CRM a few times a year, or not at all. The data they need can still be surfaced to them via an AI that not only serves their raw data needs, but also gives them insights and actions.\n\n<img class=\" wp-image-8453 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Group-27.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"372\" height=\"326\" />\n<h4>Aviso’s AI Compass Can Turn Bain’s Guidance into Actions.</h4>\nYou can use Aviso’s AI powered revenue guidance platform to do all of this immediately.\n\nWith demonstrated results across Fortune 500 companies and industry leaders such as Dell, Honeywell, Splunk, MongoDB, and RingCentral, Aviso works at the frontier of predictive AI to help teams close more deals and drive more revenue. Aviso is backed by Storm Ventures, Scale Venture Partners, Shasta Ventures, and other leading Silicon Valley investors. Since its inception, Aviso AI has generated 205 billion insights, analyzed $144B in pipeline, and driven $84B in total won deals.\n\nWhere traditional AI approaches in Sales focus on narrow slices of the process aiming to “improve” that slice for e.g. just tracking emails, or recording sales calls, or enabling reps, we approach Sales from a different angle that makes our forecasts robust and reliable.\n\nInstead of pre-identifying slices of the current process and trying to improve them, Aviso looks at all disparate data sets generated during a sales cycle (e.g. raw data in CRM, activity data from calendar, deal room conversations, and support and success tools), combine them into a single opportunity focused view, and generate training data and models which allows us to decode and isolate the human behavior which drives sales for each individual customer. This allows us to decode explicit behaviors (judgement on moving stages, categories etc), and implicit behaviors (when these values change and their sequencing).\n\nAviso’s AI uses advanced machine learning for feature discovery and model building. Aviso bootstraps history from the source systems of its customers, discovers the most predictive features for that customer and builds an ensemble of predictive models. As customers use the product, our temporal database builds a history of all data sources which our ML engine uses to retrain these models as the business and the market conditions change. Predictions from Aviso’s models are generated as insights, timely nudges and team-wide actions. Our temporal database also allows us to backtest predictions in the past and see how new model types, feature selection techniques or data sources provide gains over a wider past period.\n\n<em>Note: We are currently running a complimentary 64-hour COVID-19 <a href=\"https://info.aviso.com/reduce-covid-19-revenue-risk\">revenue risk assessment</a> for businesses to reduce deals and pipeline risk. </em>",

		"image": "https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Black-Swan-Blog-option-2-3-300x150.png",
		"content": "<em style=\"text-align:center;\">Notice: To help companies push through uncertain times, we are currently offering Aviso AI for free for 90 days.\n<a class=\"covidbtn\" href=\"https://info.aviso.com/reduce-covid-19-revenue-risk\">Assess COVID-19 Revenue Risk</a>\n</em>\n\nThose of us who read Nassim Taleb’s book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X\">Black Swan</a> know we’re <a href=\"https://medium.com/sequoia-capital/coronavirus-the-black-swan-of-2020-7c72bdeb9753\">experiencing a major shock</a> event.\n\nHere are just some of the things you are likely to hear in the coming months\n\n●  <em>“We would have won, but the other team just gave the deal away”</em>\n\n<em>●   “Because we missed intermediate milestones doesn’t mean we won’t hit our schedule”</em>\n\n<em>●   “We have high churn, but as soon as we redo our marketing, people will come back”</em>\n\nAt the end of the Dot Com bust, when large companies like SAP, Oracle, and Siebel began to miss their quarters in spades, many wondered why no one saw it coming. After all, these companies knew a slowdown was inevitable as their customers went off the cliff, but despite early warnings, each CEO reiterated strong guidance right up till the point of the actual misses. The same thing in 2008 with companies ranging from Lehman Brothers to Salesforce.\n\nWhen asked why these great CEOs would not have seen it coming, Andy Grove simply said:\n\n<em>“They were not lying to investors, but rather, they were lying to themselves.”</em>\n\nHumans often take actions on positive indicators (good news) and look to explain away negative leading indicators (bad news). After COVID, our own human biases are more amplified. For CEOs and CROs, trust in their sales team has to be balanced with vigilance in the actual sales process, cadence of activities, and customer engagement levels.\n\nIn this post I’ll focus on the uncertainty created by COVID-19 and how we can get through this crisis.  In this time, we need new kinds of leading indicators and looking back at similar events helps build a clearer picture of how to get through this crisis. At Aviso, we believe learning from the lessons of the past is the first step in surviving not just COVID-19 and its impact over the next 12 -18 months, but also <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/black-swan-a-rare-disaster-not-as-rare-as-once-believed-11584645612\">preparing for other Black Swans</a>.\n\nTo grasp fully how this rapidly evolving situation is <em>unique</em>, let’s start with a comparative analysis with previous shocks such as the 1987 Stock Market Crash, 2008 Recession, and 9/11. Though every Black Swan event in the past has had defining risk factors such as global/local economic and political conditions, credit, market, liquidity, or country -specific risk, what makes the COVID-19 timeline different is our <em>exponential increase in global connectedness</em>.\n\nThe financial market devastation is just the tip of the iceberg. What’s most striking, is the <em>pace</em> at which this virus has eroded consumer sentiment and pulled the world into a Bear market.\n\n<img class=\"wp-image-8395 aligncenter\" style=\"color: #456381;\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/StocksEvents-Chart-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"513\" />\n\nThe real iceberg is still unseen.\n\nResearchers are predicting the fallout of this novel virus to be far greater reaching than any other disease related pandemic. What is regarded by many as a largely positive societal development -- globalization -- has now become our Achilles heel over the past 2 decades. From highly accessible air travel to fragile multi-level supply chains, to seamless corporations, the same things that powered us are now making us vulnerable.\n<h4>So how exactly will my business be impacted?</h4>\nIt is important to look at the macro-indicators first. Per Yahoo “the number of Americans filing for unemployment is expected to have skyrocketed to a record-breaking <strong>1.64 million for the week ending March 21</strong>, according to economists polled by Bloomberg. The previous record was 695,000 claims filed the week ended October 2, 1982. Initial jobless claims for the week ended March 14 <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/initial-weekly-jobless-claims-jump-will-get-worse-125841739.html\">jumped by 70,000 claims to 281,000</a> and was the largest single-week increase since the Great Recession.”\n\nBut not all industries are equally affected. Consider the chart below. If you are in restaurants or real estate, this feels like Doomsday. If you are in Health or Streaming, it feels different.\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-8397 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-26-at-2.23.13-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1602\" height=\"812\" />\n\nThe extent of the impact your industry faces ultimately depends on a variety of factors:  financial resilience, sales cycles, geographical exposure, churn versus new customer acquisition rates, account sizes. All these factors are key considerations that you should be modeling into your business to forecast Q2, Q3, and Q4 and even FY ‘22.\n<h4>Novel business problems need novel technology solutions.</h4>\nCOVID-19 is a result of a “novel” virus. The word novel here has a <a href=\"https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/drug-discovery/Crystal-structures-novel-coronavirus-protease/98/web/2020/03\">specific scientific meaning</a>.\n\nTo understand the impact of a novel virus on your business, a starting point can be similar challenges experienced in the past, and how revenue forecasts dropped in those situations.\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that most companies haven’t faced a comparable set of challenging events or were at a very different state of operation when they faced that situation and hence making it difficult to compare. A workaround can be to look at an analogous set of companies and look at the respective indicators.  Additionally, you have to look at more dimensions of risk than you did previously. For e.g. the risk in sales is not just limited to your own geography, but also spans the geographies your clients operate in.\n\nAt Aviso, we believe in a <em>time series</em> approach to business uncertainty. We apply Data Science to understand the differential impact across different companies &amp; industries, across multiple past quarters, and rebasing forecasts not only for current quarter, but also next few quarters.\n\nAll of these factors are ingested and analyzed by Aviso’s AI Engine. Following is a snapshot with data masked by Aviso for one of its Fortune 500 clients.\n\n<img class=\" wp-image-8399 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Table.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"785\" height=\"420\" />\n<h4>De-risking CRM fake news with the strength of multiple signals.</h4>\nA key challenge faced by companies during Black Swan events is that their CRM and deal data loses its trustworthiness. This is due to many deals drying up as poor economic conditions lower buyer intent. However, it is important to note that CRM is a lagging indicator of lost business.\n\nCompanies then often hire analysts to build fancy spreadsheets but ultimately resort to a heuristic method of calculating a downgrade multiplier of their forecasts.\n\nAviso addresses this problem by looking at signals other than CRM to capture a live pulse. Here are just two ways in which Aviso creates a reliable AI forecast versus one via heuristics.\n\n●  Tracking the slowdown signal from Account Executive engagement and activity and intent management looking at the raw exhaust of emails, meetings, and virtual or in-person conversations\n\n●  Gauging the temperature of the deal from forecast meeting transcripts, looking not just at keywords but also sentiment analysis\n\n●  Looking at marketing activities variance, e.g. leads drying up, fallout in engagement activities\n\nAviso also looks at the opportunity level and analyses pipeline risk at a deal level based on whether the sales cycle for that deal is delayed or not, and several other factors such as sentiment tracking in external conversations with prospects and customers.\n\n<img class=\" wp-image-8398 aligncenter\" style=\"color: #456381;\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pipeline-Chart_Existing-New.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"715\" height=\"620\" />\n<h4>Using AI with multiple signals to forecast and guide growth.</h4>\nWhere traditional AI approaches in Sales focus on narrow slices of the process aiming to \"improve\" that slice for e.g. just tracking emails, or recording sales calls, or enabling sales reps, we approach Sales from a different angle that makes our forecasts robust and reliable.\n\nInstead of pre-identifying slices of the current process and trying to improve them, Aviso looks at all disparate data sets generated during a sales cycle (e.g. raw data in CRM, activity data from calendar, deal room conversations, and support and success tools), combine them into a single opportunity focused view, and generate training data and models which allows us to decode and isolate the human behavior which drives sales for each individual customer. This allows us to decode not only explicit behaviors (judgement on moving stages, categories etc), but also implicit behaviors (when are these values being changed and their sequencing).\n\nAviso’s AI uses advanced machine learning for feature discovery and model building. Aviso bootstraps history from the source systems of its customers, discovers the most predictive features for that customer and builds an ensemble of predictive models. As customers use the product, our temporal database builds a history of all data sources which our ML engine uses to retrain these models as the business and the market conditions change. Predictions from Aviso’s models are generated as insights, timely nudges and team-wide actions. Our temporal database also allows us to backtest predictions in the past and see how new model types, feature selection techniques or data sources provide gains over a wider past period.\n\nWe believe AI is a new compass to guide sales and go-to-market teams to close more deals, accelerate growth, and find their revenue True North. Aviso delivers true revenue intelligence, nudges team-wide actions, and gives precise guidance so sellers and teams don't get lost in the fog of customer databases, scattered data lakes, and inherent human biases.\n\n<img class=\" wp-image-8400 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screen-Shot-2020-03-26-at-2.32.03-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"464\" height=\"330\" />\n<h4>How Aviso’s AI Compass can help you right now.</h4>\nEvery crisis presents its own opportunities. As Sequoia Capital’s <a href=\"https://medium.com/sequoia-capital/coronavirus-the-black-swan-of-2020-7c72bdeb9753\">“Black Swan”</a> blog post said:\n\n<em>\"In downturns, revenue and cash always fall faster than expenses. As Darwin surmised, those who survive are not the strongest or the most intelligent, but the most adaptable to change.”</em>\n\nAt Aviso, we predict a “U” shaped downturn with expected impact of 1-2 quarters. Firms which can manage revenue with AI now will have an edge going forward, but they will need:\n\n● New crystal ball that looks beyond CRM (a lagging indicator) to forecast revenue\n\n● New virtual channels to stay closer to teams and customers during remote work\n\n● Nudges, not force, to help reps course correct while automating CRM data entry\n\n<a href=\"https://searchcustomerexperience.techtarget.com/news/252474654/Aviso-introduces-version-20-of-AI-guided-sales-platform?utm_campaign=Global-90-Days-Growth-Trial&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=2&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8ANt-YSq93Y8SzhtLITw22hgRzlG2PDF17ZLoyH1SbfBjzSKVpe8eyS2dts5KKy43vWdjRVyzfK9nU52UOnN1IogOk3Q&amp;_hsmi=2\">Aviso’s AI platform</a> can help mitigate risk and manage revenue growth with:\n\n● <strong>Accurate Forecasting &amp; Pipeline Planning:</strong> Using signals beyond CRM, such as emails, call recordings, meetings, relationship maps, support tools, Aviso finds the biggest risks to deliver accurate forecasts. Aviso also helps with pipeline and opportunity “nudges”, tracking across regions, renewals and run-rate business and addresses at-risk deals with upside deals &amp; pull ins from future quarters\n\n● <strong>Remote Deal Collaboration:</strong> Many of us are working remote and virtually. Aviso collaboration, forecast and deal rooms enable Reps, Managers, Customer Success, Sales Ops, Finance, IT, and Executives to virtually collaborate across time zones – giving you the best of Slack, Zoom, and Chatter. In Forecast rooms, Sales teams can access AI insights to identify deals at risk and collaborate on deals that have a higher chance of closing in the current quarter. In Deal rooms, Reps and Managers can use AI insights on performance and have better coaching discussions for longer-term impact.\n\n● <strong>CRM Burden &amp; Cost Takeout:</strong> Aviso can save CFOs 25-30% cost by eliminating non-core licenses. It also reduces reliance on CRM data entered by sales reps alone to drive forecast accuracy, while automating admin data entry that takes 25% or more of their time. Aviso integrates reps' email and calendar to auto-populate contacts and meetings into CRM, and also tracks Marketing system activity (or lack of). This improves rep productivity, provides Sales Managers with 100% visibility on activity management, and delivers a more accurate forecast to Executives to help close the quarter strong.\n<h4>In Closing:</h4>\nAt Aviso, we’ve worked for over 6 years to help Fortune 500 and high growth companies to optimize forecasts and revenue execution.

		"content": "It’s hard to improve process maturity when your CRM is holding you back.\n\nAccording to research from <a href=\"https://www.csoinsights.com/blog/how-important-is-crm-adoption-and-sales-process-maturity-for-sales-enablement-success/\">CSO Insights</a>, the more mature your sales processes, the more success you’ll have as a company. In fact, companies with formalized, well-developed sales processes hit their sales quotas almost 20% more often than companies with scrappier sales process strategies.\n\n<strong>Clearly, sales-process maturity matters.</strong>\n\nMost companies falsely equate high CRM adoption with having a mature sales process. This is easy to understand why, as data from CSO Insights also shows that deal outcomes improve <a href=\"https://www.csoinsights.com/blog/how-important-is-crm-adoption-and-sales-process-maturity-for-sales-enablement-success/\">by 6.4%</a> once CRM adoption rates hit 75%.\n\nBut here’s the rub: CSO Insights also found that <a href=\"https://www.csoinsights.com/blog/how-important-is-crm-adoption-and-sales-process-maturity-for-sales-enablement-success/\">barely two-thirds</a> of companies ever hit that 75% threshold. (Also, 75% isn’t a high number — it means that even at companies with \"mature\" sales processes, one in four sales executives still aren’t using CRM!) So if you’re thinking all you have to do is get sales reps to use your CRM, and you’ll be on your way to a mature sales process, you’re wrong.\n\nThe truth is that a high CRM adoption rate is a result rather than a cause of maturity. If you’ve got a well-organized sales process, you’ll achieve better revenue results. Then, once you’re running a disciplined, well-organized team, you’ll have more luck convincing executives to use your CRM platform.\n\nIn fact, focusing your attention on CRM adoption in lieu of fixing your sales process could actually be holding your team back. Instead, As CSO Insights <a href=\"https://www.csoinsights.com/blog/how-important-is-crm-adoption-and-sales-process-maturity-for-sales-enablement-success/\">points out</a>, sales coaching, new-hire onboarding, and customer engagement are all key areas that sales teams must master to build a mature sales process.\n\nAt best, high CRM adoption rates show how well your team is already working. At worst, they are an impediment to effective selling. <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/5-blind-spots-in-your-crm/\">Many CRM systems are filled with blind spots</a> due to bloated and siloed data sets, outdated information, and human error. Legacy CRM systems are not designed to optimize revenue teams for any of these things. You need a smarter approach.\n\nAt Aviso, we call that approach #noCRM AI Guidance. It uses AI and machine-learning to remove pain points and let sales focus on closing deals through:\n\n<strong>AI Guided Sales Coaching.</strong> Arm your managers with insights from similar past deals and ongoing activities at current deals. Build more effective coaching strategies with AI insights. Help reps spot risks or better deals early enough in a sales cycle to take corrective actions.\n\n<strong>AI Guided Sales Onboarding.</strong> Teach new sales reps the behaviors and playbooks of the best sales executives. Sales Enablement teams can accelerate a new hire’s understanding of key deals, engage with GTM team members in dedicated deal rooms, and get nudged to execute key actions in the company’s sales process.\n\n<strong>AI Guided Customer Engagement.</strong> The biggest challenges for sellers are knowing who to talk to at an account, how to generate value during every interaction, and how to handle objections. A #NoCRM approach gives your sales reps instant access to relevant relationship intelligence. This makes it easier to guide potential buyers through the sales funnel.\n\nSales process maturity doesn’t start with CRM. It starts with putting real systems and solutions in place for the challenges your team faces to ensure that your team is empowered to operate at their full potential. With a #NoCRM strategy, sales teams can also access forecasts for future deals, track progress towards revenue goals, and break down the data silos that hold them back.\n\nThe bottom line? Unfortunately, CRM adoption isn’t the solution to fixing your sales process. It’s part of the problem. Moving towards sales-process maturity means having the courage to recognize that fact. It means breaking up with outmoded CRM technology and exploring AI-enabled solutions. Your revenue team will work smarter, close deals faster, and take your company to new heights.",

		"image": "https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Product-Update-03-300x150.png",
		"content": "<strong>The Problem With CRM Bookings:</strong>\n\nIn our recent product update, <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/product-update-opportunities-acceleration/\">Opportunities Acceleration</a>, we described how one of the biggest problems with CRM systems is how close dates are entered by sales reps. Research conducted by our data science team indicates that the close dates forecasted by sales teams are often likely just placeholders in the best case, and often “fake news” in the worst case (totally made up). Taking a step back and thinking about why this is the case paints a clear picture.\n\nThe CRM close date is a required field. This forces a rep to enter a close date as soon as they create an opportunity, when they really haven't had any chance of truly understanding what that date might be. Although human intuition is often amazingly accurate and helpful, when it comes to estimating sales cycle length sales numbers it is definitely not. Why? Because there are inherent issues with way reps enter close dates. For example, they’re more likely to enter dates at the end of the month because then they have a buffer period if the deal takes longer than when they think it’ll actually close.\n\nIn addition to the fact that reps just simply have no choice but to enter a placeholder due to current sales process as determined by CRM systems, there are more psychological factors in play. Close dates projections suffer from very specific cognitive biases: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice-supportive_bias\">choice-supportive bias</a> (the tendency to retroactively ascribe positive attributes to an option one has selected); <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect\">bandwagon effect </a>(the rate of uptake of beliefs, ideas, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fads_and_trends\">fads and trends</a> increases the more that they have already been adopted by others); and certainly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias\">confirmation bias</a> (the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that affirms one's prior beliefs or hypotheses).\n\nMoreover, there is no way that a singular, likely overloaded sales rep can synthesize all the data points present about the current deal/past deals similar to the one at hand and draw a meaningful conclusion in the form of a super accurate close date. This has a compounding effect of messing up overarching CRM forecasting. This is where artificial intelligence can help. We’re excited to announce our latest update: Bookings Timeline. Read on to learn more about how it works.\n\n<strong>Validate Your Close Date</strong>\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-8039 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/booking-timeline-insights-1.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"419\" height=\"512\" />\n\nBookings timeline uses AI to validate your CRM entered close date. This feature will tell you that if the deal closes, it is likely to close either earlier or later than your projected CRM-entered date. Basically, we will take the guesswork away from the initial placeholder date. As we’ve learned, the CRM entered close date is based on gut feelings, so seeing exactly how gut-feel it is is super helpful for reps to course correct. This is key because it prevents a pain every sales team faces but doesn’t need to anymore -- finding out too late in the quarter that a deal is slipping.\n\n<strong>Bookings Timeline Explained</strong>\n\nSince machine learning powers this new feature (and Aviso's entire platform!), Bookings Timeline calculates when your deals will actually close <em>based on your organization’s unique history</em>. Each Booking Timeline includes the top factors influencing the prediction.\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-8040 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bookings-timeline-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"499\" />\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Late:</strong> Aviso thinks the deal is going to close MORE than a week later than you predicted in CRM</li>\n \t<li><strong>Early:</strong> Aviso thinks the deal is going to close LESS than a week later than you predicted in CRM</li>\n \t<li><strong>Probability (shaded in blue):</strong> The most likely close date time-zone</li>\n \t<li><strong>&gt;&gt; Fast Forward:</strong> Reason Aviso thinks the deal will get delayed</li>\n \t<li><strong>&lt;&lt; Rewind:</strong> Reason Aviso thinks the deal will be ahead of schedule</li>\n \t<li><strong>Green Target:</strong> Reason deal close date is more trust-worthy</li>\n \t<li><strong>Red Expansion:</strong> Reasons to believe close-date isn’t trust-worthy</li>\n</ol>\n<strong>Cross-referencing In-Quarter or Out-Quarter </strong>\n\nWith Booking Timeline, you can cross reference Aviso’s projected close date with the quarter bounds to determine if the opportunity is more likely to close in the current quarter or the next. This helps companies determine in their Monday forecast calls and deal reviews how and where a forecast needs to be adjusted.",

		"content": "<strong>The Problem With CRM Forecasting:</strong>\n\nIf you work in sales, you know that an ideal sales-cycle starts with a massive amount of pipeline, from which you and your team need to whittle down into opportunities you’ll actually pursue. How do you know which deals to focus on from that giant hay-field of current pipe? If you use a CRM system, it’s typically intuition on which opportunities look the most promising, or “feel good” health scores.\n\nBut what if you could know exactly which deals will close? And even better, what if you could know exactly which deals in future quarters can be pulled-in to the current quarter to close your number gap? Since we created AI-powered Deal Maps, we’ve had a huge amount of feedback on how to use AI to identify upside deals not just in current quarter but also in future quarters.\n\nAll of this and more is possible with applying machine learning to the sales process. Aviso’s newest product update, Opportunity Acceleration, gives you insight into the vast and confusing field of hay that is your existing and future pipeline. We created Opportunity Acceleration because we know that in addition to knowing what deals are most likely to close in the current quarter, sales teams also need to know which deals can be brought in to close the gap.\n\n<strong>A Surprising Fact about Where Revenue Actually Comes From:</strong>\n\nAviso Pull-Ins are what powers Opportunities Acceleration. Pull-ins help sales teams accelerate their opportunities and grow revenue faster by determining which opportunities have the highest probability of closing early if pulled into the current quarter. This is extremely valuable in order to meet your number. Why? Because of this surprising fact about sales: On average, 15% of a company’s quarterly revenue comes from deals pulled from future quarters into the current quarter.\n\n<strong>How Predictive AI Can Help:</strong>\n\n<img class=\" wp-image-8032 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pull-ins-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"715\" height=\"313\" />\n\nBy applying predictive artificial intelligence to your pipeline, you can see exactly which deals marked to close in future quarters can actually be moved up to be closed much sooner with certainty.\n\nLet’s talk about why this cannot be done with a traditional CRM system. Forecasting in CRM ties the date entered with predicted success. In reality, this won’t paint an accurate picture of predicted deal success because reps choose the forecasted close date with inherent biases, such as picking a date closer to the end of the month or not considering all of the factors going into a deal close. With machine learning, this task is data-driven, insight focused, and 96%+ accurate.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, think of your entire pipeline as a giant hayfield. Artificial intelligence can identify the hay stacks within the field (deals with the highest probability of closing if pulled-in) and show you the needles (the amount of deals you’ll actually close that are pulled-in from future quarters) hidden inside. With all this done for you, now you just have to get out there and sell! We like to think of this process as combining the best of AI insights and human execution.\n\n<strong>Pull-Ins: Prospects, Yield, and Insights:</strong>\n\n<img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-8033\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pull-ins-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"182\" />\n\n<strong>Pull-in Prospects </strong>\nWe know that not all next quarter opportunities are created equally. Aviso’s Pull-In Prospects provides you a curated list of pull-in opportunities the AI engine has identified as worth targeting in the current quarter.\n\n<strong><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-8034\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/pull-ins-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"242\" />Pull-in Yield </strong>\nWithin the set of Pull-In prospects, Aviso’s Pull-In Yield helps better understand how many of your booked opportunities for the quarter will come from next quarter pull-ins. The yield is the ratio of predicted pull-ins that will close to total quarterly predicted booked opportunities.On average, we’ve found that 15% of quarterly revenue comes from pulled-in deals.\n\n<strong>Pull-in Insights and Charts </strong>\nAviso knows a significant chunk of bookings come from Pull-Ins and Anticipated Pipe. Pull-In Insights give enhanced perspective on bookings by showing the breakdown of bookings for the current week in the last quarter. Pull-Ins Charts help understand bookings and explore their breakdown.",

		"content": "<strong>Automate and De-risk Your Forecasting Entry</strong>\n\nTraditional sales forecasting methods come with a lot of inherent biases and problems. Perhaps the most seemingly innocuous of these has potentially the most devastating effect on the end calculations: typos. By this we are referring to, say, that accidental slip of the hand where 100M total pipeline is actually supposed to be 10M total pipeline.\n\nThe sales forecasting incumbents, spreadsheet products such as Excel and Google Sheets, are entirely based on manual entry of data. This makes them prone to extreme user error. In fact, on average, <a href=\"https://incisive.com/spreadsheet-error-horror-stories/\">88% of spreadsheets have errors</a> in them.\n\nLuckily, just by nature of Aviso using machine learning to automate your forecasting for you, spreadsheet errors are a thing of the past. Our newest product feature — “Informed Editing”— de-risks this process even further.\n\nNow, when you click in to edit a forecast judgment, Aviso informs you of the quarter you are editing in and whose forecast you are updating. When entering your judgment for a direct report you can see your ‘Start of Week’ judgment as well as your direct report’s current judgment.\n\nMoreover, there is no need to worry whether your changes have been saved thanks to “Submission Reassurance.” This means that you can submit your judgments with confidence. Once Aviso has registered your entry, we will display a green confirmation box as well as a friendly check box indicating that the update has been completed.\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-8027 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Informed-Editing-gif.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"317\" />",

		"content": "We are all witnesses to the fourth industrial revolution. Emerging technologies driven by machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are upending the way the world produces, distributes, and consumes goods. Companies across industries, especially in sales and finance, have rapidly adopted and integrated AI technology into their businesses to achieve a competitive advantage.\n\nThis AI-enabled age of disruption in the sales industry has led to increased efficiency, more targeted strategies, and added capabilities. AI-powered digital solutions are streamlining the sales industry in the most profound ways.\n\n<strong>Empowering Future Sellers</strong>\n\nAI has radically changed the employment and skills acquisition strategies of companies. AI and ML algorithms are also increasingly replaced sales and marketing professionals in online stores and sales teams. The rapid adoption of AI in the industry has sparked debates on the job loss that AI-driven automation may cause. In the US sales industry, <a href=\"https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/5jlz9h56dvq7-en.pdf?expires=1569218044&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=6E2D57CEA129B15FEA831FE203245260\">the OECD estimates that retail sales workers have a 93% chance</a> of being replaced by automation.\n\nOn the other hand, <a href=\"https://qz.com/1532006/automation-will-change-every-job-but-only-25-are-on-the-chopping-block/\">research via the Brookings Institute found that the last wave of IT automation</a> in the 1980s created more jobs than it destroyed. The study projects that menial jobs will be most likely at risk of automation while IT jobs will likely grow. This reflects predictions being made by industry experts,<a href=\"https://online.maryville.edu/online-masters-degrees/software-development/\"> with Maryville University forecasting there will be 1.1 million more computing-related jobs by 2024</a>. As AI continues to disrupt the industry, sales enablement strategies will increasingly focus on complementing AI-enabled tools for sales. Re-skilling and onboarding the sales workforce will put emphasis on what AI has yet to automate—creativity, design, and innovation.\n\n<strong>Forecasting Demand</strong>\n\nThe ability to predict and model consumer demand has made planning sales strategies more data-driven and intuitive. AI-powered sales platforms enable businesses to accelerate and tailor sales cycles by generating critical insights from multiple data streams in real time.\n\nShifting beyond CRM tools, time series databases use support vector machines to forecast demand, monitor customer bases, and predict new opportunities. <a href=\"http://www.aviso.com/blog/time-series-database-close-more-deals/\">Aviso WinScore supplies guided selling insights</a> to aid sales managers in attuning their sales execution to secure successful deals. Time series DB’s can also create advanced warning mechanisms that detect when customers are considering switching brands. These insights are invaluable to companies that want to remain competitive in this new era.\n\n<strong>Improved Lead Generation</strong>\n\nLead generation is becoming more automated, personalized, and relevant with AI applications. <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/sujan-patel/how-artificial-intelligence-could-change-future-of-sales.html\">Harvard Business Review research found</a> that sales companies that utilize AI have 50% more leads than non-adaptors. Platforms like Facebook, Google, and LinkedIn already use machine learning algorithms to serve personalized advertisements to consumers, tailored to their specific interests.\n\nAI lead generation tools today enables businesses to offer chatbots and conversational marketing embedded within websites and landing pages. Advanced applications also include insights for cross-selling and up-selling opportunities.\n\n<strong>Personalizing The In-Store Experience</strong>\n\nCultivating stellar customer relationships remains the best way to grow businesses. Besides conversational marketing, AI utilizes data to optimize the company’s approach strategies in sales.\n\nCompanies use predictive analytics to uncover buying signals and identify customer pain points in the sales cycle. This allows them to identify the most convenient times and the most relevant details to specific target audiences. This process increases customer satisfaction and the possibility of conversion success. Natural language processing has also drastically improved machine translation—a factor that’s important in raising long-term market relevance.\n\n<strong>Getting to Omni-Channel Faster</strong>\n\nConsumers today use different channels to make different purchases. Successful omni-channel strategies need to intelligently identify, guide, and satisfy consumers at every stage of the sales and conversion cycle. AI and machine learning can help align and fine-tune customer relations across channels seamlessly. AI can efficiently combine and utilize multiple data sources like product preferences, location data, and transaction histories throughout devices and platforms.\n\nAs AI strengthens its grip over the sales industry, companies can either learn to swim with the tide or sink under the weight of the new industrial revolution.\n\n<em>Article written by Lucy Anders exclusively for aviso.com. </em>",

		"content": "Customer relationships are at the heart of the sales process. In 2020, 74% of all companies report using CRM software, with adoption helping increase sales by up to 29%, productivity by up to 34%, and <span style=\"color: #b03367;\"><a style=\"color: #b03367;\" href=\"https://www.nutshell.com/blog/crm-stats/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">forecast accuracy by 42%</a></span>. So what's the deal with <strong>NoCRM?</strong> What does NoCRM mean in theory and in practice? And what can it mean to you if you live and breathe the world of sales and revenue?\n\nLet's start by taking a step back.\n<h2><strong>A Brief Look Back In Time</strong></h2>\nThe CRM industry started in the early 1980s. If it were an adult it would be a part of Gen X, between baby boomers and millenials.\n\nSince the first CRM launched, a lot has happened in terms of technological advancement. We went from cassette tapes and DVDs to Netflix and Youtube. We went from taxis to Uber to peak Uber, from IRC Chat to Yahoo Messenger to WhatsApp. The technologies in our personal life make life easy and allow us to do more with less.\n\nIn theory, that was the promise of CRM. CRM was meant to be easy to use.\n\nIn reality, while CRM helped millions of businesses embrace the cloud, it has also created a false equivalence between data capture and sales performance.\n\n<strong>It demands more from reps than it gives.</strong>\n\nWhile the number of CRM systems has exponentially increased (there are 379 CRMs on G2 Crowd and counting) ROI outcomes have remained below par:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Less than 30% of CRM projects succeed per <span style=\"color: #b03367;\"><a style=\"color: #b03367;\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/12/why-crm-projects-fail-and-how-to-make-them-more-successful\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Harvard Business Review</a></span></li>\n \t<li>66% of sales reps’ time is wasted on non-selling activities per <span style=\"color: #b03367;\"><a style=\"color: #b03367;\" href=\"https://technologyadvice.com/blog/sales/2018-state-sales-report/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Salesforce Reports</a></span></li>\n \t<li>CRM adoption refuses to budge beyond 15-20% per <span style=\"color: #b03367;\"><a style=\"color: #b03367;\" href=\"https://www.csoinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/08/2016-Sales-Performance-Optimization-Study-Key-Trends-Analysis.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">CSO Insights</a></span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>The Problem with CRM Today</strong></h2>\nWait a minute, you might say…Wasn’t CRM going to be the shiny bellwether for enterprise software and for the future of work? And since CRM has grown from a $10B to $120B industry, rep quota attainment must have gone up too, right?\n\nNo! It has fallen to an <a href=\"https://blog.stormventures.com/aviso-a-nocrm-approach-to-sales-1710dbc224fb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span style=\"color: #b03367;\">all-time low of 43%</span></a> in 2018, down from 66% in 2011.\n\nIf it continues down this path, CRM spending will be up to <strong>$1.2 trillion</strong>, and attainment will drop to <strong>less than 20%</strong> in the next 10 years. There is no positive correlation between rep attainment and CRM spending. (In fact, the correlation might even be negative.)\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-7951 size-full\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/State-of-revenue-performance.png\" alt=\"The state of revenue performance. Charts of outcome of forecasted opportunities and percentage of reps achieving quota.\" width=\"616\" height=\"318\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4>In theory, CRM started off as a way to help reps.</h4>\nThe idea was that if reps fill in their fields, enter in their next-steps, and stay on top of appointments, then they were much more likely to close more deals.\n<h4>In practice, more and more people wanted information out of CRM as time progressed.</h4>\nLegal, Procurement, Marketing, requested that more fields be added and kept updated. This wound up putting more administrative burden on sales reps.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Over time, CRM has become a huge, lumbering database. It is a beast constantly hungry for more fields, events, and time spent with very little return.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Sailing Beyond CRM</strong></h2>\nSales technology cannot continue down this path if it has to help reps and teams succeed. <strong>That’s where NoCRM comes in.</strong>\n<blockquote>“NoCRM” is a call to break free from the shackles of the CRM product experience. “NoCRM” is a better reality where reps focus on deal guidance, instead of spending their afternoons on data fluffing. “NoCRM” is a brave new world of the modern, AI-powered salesperson and GTM teams of the future.</blockquote>\nSo what does “NoCRM” look like? Are we suggesting that GTM teams go back to the dark ages and run their businesses out of Excel? No, of course not!\n\nRather, we need focus. We need guidance. We need the technology of the future to be the foundation of a sales organization.\n\nWith that, AI is the secret sauce <strong>that makes NoCRM possible</strong>. With AI augmentation, you can manage and run your sales organization in a completely new way, with real results.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-7952\" style=\"font-size: 0.875em;\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/crmvsnocrm.png\" alt=\"Chart of CRM versus noCRM.\" width=\"615\" height=\"315\" />\n<h2><strong>NoCRM with LessIsMore</strong></h2>\nImagine if you could use AI to augment your reps and GTM teams <strong>to do more with less</strong>. That’s a philosophy that we at Aviso call #LessIsMore -- where teams use the power of leverage to win more deals by working smarter, not harder.\n\nImagine if there was a way <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/pipeline-acceleration/\">to <span style=\"color: #b03367;\">know the “golden” fields in your CRM database</span></a> that progress deals and are the key predictors of deal health. Imagine if those were the only fields your reps had to update, instead of a mind-numbing aggregate of contact information and interactions.\n\nImagine if reps could get<span style=\"color: #b03367;\"><a style=\"color: #b03367;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/new-product-update-nudges/\"> recommended insights and actions</a></span> as mobile, course-correcting “nudges” in the same way that your Apple Watch nudges you to get your heart rate in the safe zone.\n\nImagine if managers, CFOs and CROs could blend the best of both human intuition and AI judgment to <span style=\"color: #b03367;\"><a style=\"color: #b03367;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/conversational-intelligence/\">unify their forecasting and deal execution</a></span> in AI-powered collaboration rooms.

Sales leaders are adopting this technology and combining human and artificial intelligence to augment the sales coaching experience. To learn more about how our own sales leaders feel about guided selling, we sat down with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-thome-539b88b/\">Michael Thome</a> -- VP of North America Sales here at <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/\">Aviso</a> -- for a chat about his personal experience and thoughts. Check out the video or read the Q&amp;A below to learn more.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[embed]https://vimeo.com/361870299[/embed]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Q: How did you get into selling?</strong>\n\nA: About 20 years ago, I started as a customer service representative for a company. As I started my first year, I saw other folks who started before me get evaluated for their performance. This was fairly subjective based on what their manager thought of their work; they would either get a bonus or they wouldn’t get a bonus.\n\nAs a result, I started thinking that I wanted to be in more control of my destiny. I wanted to do that in a way in which I could also impact myself positively financially as well as be more of a direct player in bringing on a new customer. There was a sense of excitement that I saw in sales reps who were closing business. I got excited about that too.\n\n<strong>Q: What is being a sales leader at Aviso like day-to-day? </strong>\n\nA: As a startup, for us, sales encompasses so many different things. At other later stage companies you’re focused on your pipeline, your forecast, and you’re looking at your managers who are managing the reps and you’re making sure that they’re being coached properly and they’re getting the right information to sell properly.\n\nBut when you’re at a startup that is semi-mature but still in a pretty early stage, you’re doing everything from marketing, interviews, technology planning, and working with the engineering team. You’re doing all of these things in addition to going out and meeting with executives at companies that you are trying to do business with.\n\nSo it’s a lot of different hats, it’s all hours of the day, it’s on an airplane, it's in a car, and it’s on the phone, literally 15 to 20 hours a day. You either love that and it's part of your DNA or you don’t. For me, I love it!\n\n<strong>Q: What does guided selling mean to you and how have you seen that play out in the market over time? </strong>\n\nA: Guided selling, for me, has always been about human experience and human coaching. When I was working with a past manager, she would sit down with me and tell me why a deal was at risk and why we thought we could close it.\n\nWhat I’m seeing today is based on advancements in data science technology. We can now leverage data science to provide AI driven insights about deal health on everything from the individual deal all the way up to global forecasts, whether it’s by product, by region, by rep, by industry, or anyway you want to manage your business.\n\nEssentially, what we’re finding is that there’s a better way to do sales than just relying on human expertise alone. By using AI guidance on top of human guidance, you will actually guarantee yourself a better revenue outcome. We’ve seen that AI guidance in your sales cycle acts almost like an individual coaching mechanism for your manager to be able to sit down and ask: “What do we think we know about this opportunity based on human experience, but also now what is the AI telling us about this?” Being able to marry those two together creates a better outcome for you, your manager, and the company.\n\n<strong>Learn More</strong>\n\nThat was Michael Thome, an Aviso sales leader, talking about his sales journey and how AI has changed guided selling over his career.

		"content": "Have you ever wondered what qualities top salespeople consider vital to success? Well, lucky for you, in the book Stop Kidding Yourself, Charles Forsgard outlines what he considers the most important aspects of a successful sales team. Forsgard, an authority figure in the field, brings together over 30 years of sales experience at Schneider Electric, GE, and Honeywell in this book.\n\nWe were so inspired by Charles’ book that we recorded a bite-sized video of key takeaways.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[embed]https://vimeo.com/353416308[/embed]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[embed]https://vimeo.com/353867827[/embed]\n\nIn this post, we go deeper into the main takeaways from this book:\n<h4>Focus:</h4>\nForsgard emphasizes that sales organizations should design processes and tools keeping sellers at the center of their efforts. They should know their salespeople and cater to their strengths. <em>What type of salesperson are they? What help do they need to close more deals? Are they a true salesperson?</em> These are some questions that can help sales managers optimize their team. Furthermore, managers should coach their teams by asking them questions to stimulate thinking and help reps solve problems autonomously. Coaching in this manner is tough; it requires active and thoughtful questioning. The end result however, will be a sales team of A+ players, all playing to their strengths.\n<h4>Organize:</h4>\nForsgard highlights the importance of being organized. Salespeople need to stay on top of their calls and appointments, which involves keeping a rigorous calendar. Having this calendar in your head, or notebook may be easier, but this often leads to a mistake. The question is: Will this be a <em>thousand </em>dollar mistake, or a<em> million </em>dollar mistake? This includes actively and intelligently capturing customer data with modern tools, carefully planning every touch (especially calls), ensuring follow ups for each opportunity, and using time wisely. Asking for help when it's needed saves both time and resources.\n<h4>AI:</h4>\nLast but not least, Forsgard explains that AI is the future of selling. What this means is that CRM and other data from past quarters can be plugged into a predictive software. This helps sales teams forecast where they'll land for the quarter, and determine whether or not specific deals will close and what amount they would close for. But what does this mean for a sales rep, manager, or CRO?\n\nFor the rep, it means they have guidance, and know which deals to focus on. They get reminders when a deal is going stale, and alerts about at-risk deals in commit. They can also get visuals of what deals have been booked, what deals are left in the pipe, their quota, call, and AI Prediction.\n\nManagers are provided with the same visualization for each rep, and AI insights enable them to analyze which deals the rep should be coached on. This helps have laser focused coaching focusing on relevant deals.\n\nThe CRO is provided with an accurate forecast of where the sales organization will land for the quarter, eliminating guesswork and holes in knowledge. The CRO or their Sales Operations team can segment this data by region, product line, or even by each individual.\n<h4>Putting It All Together:</h4>\nWorking together, these elements provide the entire sales team with visibility, make their pipeline cleaner, and allow for more effective use of time for both sales reps and managers.\n\nForsgard emphasizes that these three traits need to work together to create a sales team with visibility and purpose. Here at Aviso, we strongly agree with Forsgard’s philosophy; we have built an AI platform that brings together forecasting, deal execution, and guided selling. Aviso WinScores gives the probability a deal will close in the current quarter. These WinScores are accompanied by insights around deal pacing, anomalies, and next best actions. Aviso insights are precise, accurate, and proven to be 90%+ accurate. We are able to do this by inputting data from CRM, financial tools, deal/rep activity, and more into our time-series database. From here, we can backtest our data and ensure the most accurate model is chosen.\n\nAt Aviso, we fully agree with Charles Forsgard’s message that AI can focus, organize, and turbocharge your sales team while preventing the waste of time and resources.

		"content": "I recently joined Aviso, a predictive AI startup that supercharges guided selling, as CEO. In this journey, I’m excited to work closely with <a href=\"https://www.stormventures.com/author/tae/\">Tae Hea Naam</a> and the team at Storm Ventures towards the <a href=\"https://blog.stormventures.com/aviso-a-nocrm-approach-to-sales-1710dbc224fb\">new frontier of Sales</a>; build upon the prescient vision of unicorn founder <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/k-v-rao-51748\">KV Rao</a>.\n\nBeing a CEO is a surreal experience. It acts as a truth serum for your ecosystem (people tell you things they’ve been waiting to for a long time) and for your own self (you ask yourself things you’ve not asked in a while). I wrote this post to share my motivations to undertake this journey.\n\nWhen I was following my passion for math, game theory, and gritty contact sports in university, I never thought then that I would spend two amazing decades in sales. I grew up in Europe and Asia surrounded by academics, diplomats, and naval officers. Sales seemed high on personal touch, but low on the prefrontal cortex. I wanted to be at the frontier of action, do a Ph.D in game theory, race in F1, play with the All Blacks. What happened?\n\nMeeting amazing sellers happened. As a consultant in aerospace and defense, I found sales leaders were some of the people I related to most in companies I consulted with. They were only a little like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4PE2hSqVnk\">Glengarry Glenross</a>. They were a blend of passion and numbers. They leveraged and hedged risks. They were not afraid to make big bets if their intuition and the data supported it. They were modern pioneers.\n\nAs I took the plunge into the deep end of selling, I also learned that sales was hard. It was a whole-body problem. It needed strategy, story, operational discipline, and an ability to hear \"no\" ninety-nine times before succeeding once. It had a lot more in common with the kinds of risks Magellan took circumnavigating the globe than a 9 to 5 job of emails and cold calls.\n\nAs a new sales manager who had never carried a bag, I had to embrace that this was a different career path than any I had envisioned. I relied heavily on my experience of varied cultures and viewpoints, and applied it to sales. Great selling meant thriving in unstructured environments, while bringing process change and discipline.\n\nI learned in my <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevortemplar\">revenue leadership roles</a> at Oracle, Salesforce, and Tact.ai that while great sales teams learn to be comfortable doing the uncomfortable, the technologies to serve great sales teams tend to make them more of the latter than productive.\n\nAll these years, I’ve been conscious and intentional about pitching to where the puck is going to be. And regardless of what technologies I’ve sold, the one question I get most from other sales leaders, CEOs, and investors is:\n<blockquote>“Trevor, how do you guide your salespeople and get teams to consistently exceed quota? In other words: since CRM isn't living up to its promise, where do you see it in the next 5-10 years?”</blockquote>\nAfter all, Uber gets us to destinations easier. Waze gets us to destinations faster. Tesla gets us to our destinations hands-free. What do salespeople have as a system of guidance?\n\nGuidance is more than just going tactically from point A to point B. It is about looking at dynamic buyer markets through a different lens, of learning how to approach problems with a beginners mind and bringing teams together around a customer’s needs. In a world where a majority of the buyer’s journey is spent digitally, how do you predict deals and drive outcomes?\n\nWhen I first came across Aviso and met <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/k-v-rao-51748\">KV</a>, I was quite amazed. Starting with deep AI, SaaS, and Wall Street roots (KV had built Zuora, now a unicorn, ground up and was on the founding team at Webex), their AI had delivered 90% plus accuracy for forecasts at a billion-dollar scale. The team had built a platform that could align both forecasting with sales execution.\n\nI’ve joined <a href=\"http://www.aviso.com\">Aviso</a> as CEO to build a new kind of AI Compass for a more guided future for sales teams. I’ve also joined to build a new kind of company that shows the true power of a future, where humans and AI work together to get to our human goals faster, where salespeople spend their time focused on closing more deals, versus getting lost in the fog of CRM. Today we are focused on helping drive revenue growth and we aspire to take the power of predictive AI to help everyone in the world make better decisions and get guidance to get to their goals.\n\nIf salespeople are modern explorers, AI can be their compass. A compass towards greater purpose, not just incremental revenue, but acceleration of outcomes in any industry.\n\nI’ll end this post with one of my favorite Marcus Aurelius quote:\n<blockquote>Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth. When you arise in the morning, think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive - to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love. Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking.</blockquote>\nAs a CEO, my goal is to build a culture that embraces transparency and clarity; a team that constantly challenges its assumptions and embraces suspending judgment in the status quo.\n\nI strongly believe everybody wins in an ecosystem where we leverage the best networks; where talent flourishes and works fluidly regardless of boundaries of geography, gender, race, space, and time.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/careers/\">We’re hiring</a>.

		"content": "Fortune 500 companies that are executing their sales operations with AI have found a competitive advantage that their competition just doesn't have the discipline to implement. Such companies are relying on data in a very different way. Every company has plenty of data and in many cases too much data. What is absent from their data is recognizing how it changes from <strong>minute to minute</strong> and how <strong>data correlation</strong> reveals things not visible to the naked eye. AI makes the invisible visible.\n\nMost companies just view data in <strong>traditional analytics tools and CRM systems</strong> that present where things stand right now. They don’t leverage a time series database and cannot correlate data to reveals critical insights. If you are using static data, the only value is you know where you are right now. Nothing there tells you where you need to go and how to get there.\n\nApplying<strong> time series capabilities and forecasting algorithms</strong> to your data reveals things you would never have known otherwise including important things like what you need to do differently to close an important deal. This qualitative analysis can be applied on a deal by deal basis to help even the highest performing salespeople improve their chances of winning.\n<blockquote>A significant improvement for companies using time-series databases is you can use this technology to help ‘B’ and ‘C’ salespeople perform more like ‘A’s.’ Leading companies are are getting more out of their B and C players.</blockquote>\nHere is what happens when you use the data in a standard way. A sales organization creates their forecast through a typical roll up process (AE to manager, manager to regional manager, regional manager to VP, etc.). The reporting/analytics tool tells everyone what was rolled up and what is in the various forecast categories in terms of dollars that will be closed. Then there is a drill down process of asking the AE detailed questions about the deals to get a “gut” feeling as to where the deal stands, where there are risks, how you will win, why you might lose, etc.\n\nThis human judgment process has proven to be very inaccurate when you look at results from a micro level. In plain terms, deal by deal forecast judgement is often <strong>40-50% wrong</strong>. While this in itself significantly hurts the business, the real shame is you never get key insights on what you could have been done to win the deal.\n<blockquote>If you are focusing on 50 or so deals a quarter, you probably can get away with using spreadsheets, reporting tools, etc. But if the sales organization has hundreds or thousands of deals a quarter, relying on static data just gives you “people judgment.” This limited judgement is like rowing a boat with only one oar in the water.</blockquote>\nUsing AI-based algorithms with time-series databases, you learn so much more about your deals than you ever have before. Thats why t<a href=\"http://techrepublic.com/article/why-time-series-databases-are-exploding-in-popularity/\">ime-series databases have been rising in popularity</a> over time and why we embraced this technology.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7787\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/tsdb.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"543\" />\n\nAviso customers close, on average, <strong>20% more deals</strong> per quarter than they did prior to using Aviso. Aviso applies sophisticated AI to every opportunity in your quarterly pipeline to create highly accurate win probabilities. We call this the Aviso WinScore. Then we compare the Aviso WinScore to the current forecast category the opportunity is in to alert you whenever there is a disconnect.\n\nIn most cases there are often several disconnects. For example, your team may have a deal in upside or commit but the Aviso WinScore and AI rates it much lower. From there, the AI provides guided selling insights, so sales managers and AE’s can adjust their sales execution to win these deals.\n\nWe can even integrate the AI driven Aviso Win Scores into your favorite BI tool so you can leverage AI with those platforms.\n\nHere is what one of our customers, Dell EMC says:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NODcwqy-ye4[/embed]\n<blockquote>Aviso has changed the way we conduct our deal reviews and we have made a major advancement. Now we use the AI-driven Aviso WinScores and we compare them to the forecast category. Often we have deals in commit but Aviso rates them lower so we then drill down and get actionable guidance how to improve our chances of winning. The sales team now comes to the meetings more prepared with action plans to win. Aviso helps us win more deals!” <strong>– Jay Flanagan, Senior Director of Strategy and Transformation, Dell EMC</strong></blockquote>\n&nbsp;",

		"content": "<i>“My CRM is a sparkling picture of absolute truth”</i> —said no one, ever. Except Dr. Seuss.\n\nWe all know CRM tells an incomplete story about the state of your business. We know that data isn’t always formatted properly, or that the fields don’t match our business perfectly.\n\nBut <i>just how wrong</i> is your CRM data? How do these inaccuracies, in sum, impact your mission-critical sales forecast? How much could your CRM data—and lack of organized metadata—be messing with your revenue?\n\nOur AI team has identified 5 common data blind spots in CRM. Understanding them could be key to delivering a more accurate forecast and closing more pipeline.\n\n<b>Blind Spot I: Inactive Owners can still sell things</b>\n\nRemember when Jane left last week to start a company? Jane is now an “Inactive Owner,” meaning she’s been scrubbed from your CRM, but there are still open opportunities tied to her former accounts. These opportunities aren’t any less likely to close just because their owner has left, and yet because they have an “inactive owner,” they can no longer show up on the sales forecast. This is a counter-intuitive example of CRM data being “dirty,” simply due to the structural reality that the minute an active owner is toggled to “inactive,” the footprint of their pipeline is essentially gone too and should be immediately reassigned.\n\n<b>Blind Spot II: Won Deals don't always stay Won</b>\n\nThe champagne has been popped and everyone’s celebrating a major deal that just closed. But is this deal… for real? Turns out, 97% yes, and 3% no. When we analyzed this factor across all our clients, the “win rate” of won deals turned out to be ~97%. That means 3% of “won deals” become “un-won”—maybe they fall apart in legal, maybe the “win” was prematurely entered. Who knows!? But the reality is that your revenue forecast probably counts a won deal as revenue on the books. Once again your CRM data has failed you.\n\n<b>Blind Spot III: Backdating Happens</b>\n\nEveryone backdates. It’s not like CRMs are real-time 24/7 monitoring systems that auto-update based on our every thought and action. But all this backdating (entering in data retroactively, sometimes weeks or months later) has an impact on how truthful your CRM can really be. Knowing the conditions, triggers and cycles of backdating that will inevitably occur in your sales org, much like knowing the weather, will help you make a more accurate revenue forecast than if you acted like backdating doesn’t exist. It turns out that the metadata associated with backdating is possible to model and predict— with AI.\n\n<b>Blind Spot IV: Listed Amount vs. Final Amount </b>\n\nHaving certainty around listed vs. final price is usually nice, but this isn’t the case in listed deals vs. final deals. Typically final closing amounts for the average deal vary quite a lot from the listed value during the sales process. And unfortunately, the Final Amount is usually less than what was projected. Final deal amounts can also go up, but in general, your CRM data is going to overshoot the total amount your deals will actually close for. The exact degree of inflation is anyone’s guess—unless you have an AI tool like Aviso to predict (with at least 90% accuracy) the final amount of every deal in your pipeline.\n\n<b>Blind Spot V: Listed Close Date? Simply Add 2 Weeks with Water.</b>\n\nReps overestimate how quickly they can close a deal by approximately 2 weeks. To make matters worse, most reps rarely underestimate. This optimism is especially dangerous when close dates are early or mid-quarter. Time-inflation can functionally cause a domino effect, pushing the actual close date of numerous deals later and later (even into the next quarter), which is disastrous for the forecast and revenue targets. Having a tool that forecasts actual close dates with 90% accuracy is your defense against this blind spot.\n\nAviso exists to illuminate every dark corner of CRM data and metadata with the power of AI, and turn that hidden information into actionable insights that raise sales revenues.\n<blockquote>Your CRM data may be horrendous, but with the power of Artificial Intelligence, your sales forecasts and revenue results don’t have to be.</blockquote>",

		"image": "https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Optimized-art-blue-boat-194094-1-452x300.jpg",
		"content": "We spend a significant amount of time collaborating with customers’ CROs to help them optimize their sales organizations and drive pipeline. The metric that gets the most attention is the <strong>exact close rate percentage by forecast category throughout the Quarter.</strong>\n\nTime and time again, when we show CROs their actual close rate by commit, upside, pipeline, and whatever their categories are, they are surprised that the percentages are so low. They often respond with the statement that<em> “it’s <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/this-is-why-your-sales-forecasts-are-inaccurate/\">probably an anomaly</a> because that Quarter we had some deals that were unique, significant in size, new marketing programs that generated different kinds of leads, etc.”</em> But then when we show three or four trailing quarters and they prove to be consistent, they lean forward and take notice.\n<h2>Exact Close Rate Percentage</h2>\nThis is an important metric to measure throughout the quarter vs just at the end of it. This is a metric that should be evaluated at all levels - by VP, region, sales director, and even down to the AE. This metric reveals your vulnerability and allows you to make critical course adjustments in time to improve the team’s performance. With this metric, the CRO and sales leadership team can proactively evaluate themselves and make territory/headcount recommendations before questions come from the CFO and CEO.\n\nHowever, every time we ask CROs what percentage of the deals her/his team closes that are in “Commit”, they say some number greater than 80% and often, greater than 90%. Most sales organizations do not achieve this level of close rate.\n\nHere is an example of a straightforward dashboard from the Aviso system of aggregate data from a few sales teams in the 'high-tech’ industry.\n\nIn this case, the data shows that they only close between 54% and 62% of the deals that are in commit throughout the Quarter. This is a clear indication of two things. First, deals that should be won are lost to the competition, or second, too many deals are slipping which reveals that many should never have been in \"Commit\" in the first place. In this case, an improved deal coaching strategy is needed.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-7369 size-full\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image2.png\" alt=\"Graph of win rates by FC, with weeks into quarter on thee x axis and win rates on the y axis for Q3 forecast.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" />\n\nOf all the opportunities in the “pipeline” (over 500) only between 4% and 8% closed. There are a lot of people chasing after deals that prove to be a waste of everyone’s time. This is obviously an issue. Most of these CROs knew there was a problem, but these specific statistics helped them to focus clearly and make adjustments to sales org strategy.\n\nIt’s important to also assess how the percentages change as the Quarter progresses. The data reveals that they actually close more deals early in the Quarter that are in \"Commit' than at the end. Most sales organizations close a larger percentage of what is still in commit towards the end of the quarter because if it is still in \"commit\", one would assume it is going to close.\n\nHere is another example. Similar issues as explained above.\n<h2><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-7370 size-full\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image1.png\" alt=\"Graph of win rates by FC, with weeks into quarter on thee x axis and win rates on the y axis for Q4 forecast.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" />Common Misinterpretations</h2>\nA <strong>very important</strong> point to understand is that many sales leaders will say that they understand that all the deals aren’t closing this Quarter, but they will close in the next or in future Quarters, so these deals should stay in and be worked by the sales team.\n\nWe constantly analyze the data and have found that only between 5% to 10% of non-closed deals actually close the next quarter. Hence, too many low-quality deals are making it into the pipeline and a significant amount of money and time is being wasted.\n\nUnfortunately, CRM systems do not have <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/time-series-database-close-more-deals/\">time-series database</a> capabilities, so they can’t generate this kind of AI-driven analysis. You can through the tedious process of taking snapshots every week, saving the reports, and asking your sales operations people to spend hours <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/the-top-3-ways-ai-guided-forecasting-beats-spreadsheets/\">crunching through numbers</a> to get you these metrics but is that really good enough in the age of self-driving cars?\n\n&nbsp;",

		"content": "Aviso's AI Research team has identified 5 counter-intuitive insights hidden in your CRM. Think of these as unexpected friendly winds that will help you hit your target. How did we discover them? By <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/ai-sales-forecasting/\">using AI to analyze trillions of data points</a> across our customers from hundreds of quarters of real sales results. Whether it’s day 1 of the quarter or a week from close, it is always there looking at you from the horizon: your forecast. If you dare to look at your CRM forecast, it can feel like a gut punch: you may be millions of dollars away from your target, with no hail-mary prospects to come to the rescue. Read on to see how to use some counter-intuitive insights to close deals and properly utilize CRM data.\n<h2>INSIGHT I: Deals not yet in your pipeline will HELP YOU WIN this quarter</h2>\nTake a guess on Day 1 of the quarter: how many new deals will enter your pipeline in the next 90 days and close? What % of revenue will these deals represent? 5 percent? 10 percent? The real answer is 20-40 percent. These deals are known as “The Unborn” in data science— deals not yet on your radar that will make up a meaningful percentage of total sales. Surveys with operations and reps show “unborn” opportunities are underestimated—but deals that begin and close in the same quarter can sometimes account for almost half of the results. Up to 40 percent of this quarter’s revenue isn’t even in the picture yet.\n<blockquote>\n<h3><strong><em>\"Up to 40 percent of this quarter’s revenue isn’t even in the picture yet\"</em></strong></h3>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>INSIGHT II: Deals CURRENTLY listed in a future quarter WILL close this quarter</h2>\nA common tendency by sales reps is to list an opportunity's estimated close date as next quarter in CRM, while make it close this quarter. When those future-dated deals close, it’s called a “<a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/deal-intelligence/\">Pull-In</a>”: deals that are listed in a future quarter but close this quarter, and therefore don’t register on this quarter’s sales forecast. Pull-ins account for 10-20% of quarterly sales revenue. In fact, much to the chagrin of sales ops leaders and forecasters, this little data-entry technique is becoming more and more common, as it gives sales reps more control over their projected pipeline. Understanding your true estimated pull-in rate can be a game-changer in generating a more accurate forecast.\n<blockquote>\n<h3>\"Pull-ins account for 10-20% of quarterly sales revenue\"</h3>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>INSIGHT III: DEALS marked as $0 until they win AREN'T REALLY ZERO</h2>\nWhat is a Pull-in’s best friend? A zero! “Zeros” are deals marked as $0 until they win, so they don’t count towards the forecast or pipeline. Sometimes a zero is due to a data-entry error in CRM, and sometimes reps intentionally hide the opportunity (for a spell) from the powers-that-be.  There could be a lot of money just sitting in your quarter's pipeline—and you didn't even know about it. Time to start counting those zeros.\n<blockquote>\n<h3>\"What is a Pull-in’s best friend? A zero\"</h3>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>INSIGHT IV: Deals CAN come back from the dead</h2>\nIn our data, between 1 and 3 percent of opportunities marked “dead” in a CRM eventually end up closing—some within the current quarter. Why does this happen? Some sales reps continue nurturing an opportunity even though it’s been labeled dead—making it hard to estimate the total zombies in your pipeline. Or sometimes an unforeseen circumstance on the prospect’s end transforms the <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/5-surprising-reasons-why-your-deals-arent-closing-and-what-to-do-instead/\">deal from dead to “must sign now!”</a>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>\"Between 1 and 3% of opportunities marked “dead” in CRM end up closing\"</h3>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>INSIGHT V: Deals CAN BE much bigger than AS listed in A CRM</h2>\nSales reps often under-report the potential size of a large iceberg-sized opportunity in their sales CRM data. Sometimes they don’t want a large potential deal to cross the radar of higher-ups yet to avoid the daily, unending questions about how the opportunity is going. Sometimes the conversation with the prospect starts out small, but evolves into a much bigger potential deal—and the CRM hasn’t been updated to reflect it. For many reasons, CRM could be littered with Icebergs: deals that are much bigger than they are listed as in the CRM, and when they close, your sales forecast is going to look a lot prettier.\n<blockquote>\n<h3>\"CRM could be littered with Icebergs\"</h3>\n</blockquote>\nAt Aviso, we love diving deep into the dark, bottomless data of databases like CRMs and other sales systems and signals to find all the hidden opportunities that customers might not be seeing. We use AI to uncover real upside that human forecasting can’t predict. We turn these counter-intuitive insights into actionable directives that can help sales teams close over 20 percent more deals, help sales ops predict the next quarter with 95% percent plus accuracy, and help revenue teams find their true north.",

For example, two deals might have a score of 60, but one of them might reduce to 40 next week, unless it moves to a procurement stage, because that particular deal fits the profile of a longer procurement cycle.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7337\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image3-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nNew Opportunity Acceleration Charts are also available which enable sales teams to identify deals forecasted to close in the following Quarter and “pull” them back in to close in the current Quarter. This data is invaluable as most managers and reps don’t look to next Quarter when it comes to identifying promising opportunities that can be accelerated to close.\n\nAviso’s AI looks at the entire open pipeline for next quarter and generates WinScores for that quarter. With the new Opportunity Acceleration Charts sales can identify the top 20% of next quarter’s pipeline that represent the best opportunities to potentially pull forward to close this quarter.\n\nOur back testing, with real customer data, has shown a 10x win rate increase when pull-in opportunities are selected from this AI-generated list, compared to the usual win rate of pull-in deals.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7338\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image4-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nUpdates to Opportunity Maps include a new set of Forecast Categories as well as an entirely new UI for Mobile. With these new Forecast Categories sales managers and reps have more flexibility to manage the forecasting process and will be able to more accurately forecast deals.\n\nWith our new Mobile UI teams now have full access to maps with the ability to drill down, at the opportunity level, and take corrective action all via their mobile device. The Opportunity Map now has new options for comparing the Aviso recommendations to Sales judgment. Sales people can choose forecast ‘categories’, as well as Aviso’s Deal Level Forecasting, to baseline the forecasted part of the open pipeline.\n\nAviso’s AI engine then recommends an alternative set of opportunities that match the Sales selected forecasted opportunities. Our back testing consistently shows a higher win rate (more Upside, less Risk) with Aviso’s recommended Opportunities rather than relying on Sales judgment alone.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7336\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image2-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\nAviso has also added the Opportunity Map and Opportunity Insights AI capabilities to Mobile. Sales managers can now see, at a glance on their mobile device, key trends in the Forecast as well as a summary of Opportunities with the most Risk as well as Upside.\n\nWith a few clicks, the app also provides AI insights on individual Opportunities as well as an easy way to update any key fields related to Opportunity. We have also added the AI aggregate forecast trend to Mobile, so Sales leaders can instantly spot key changes, and drive action plans with their sales teams.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7335\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image1-1024x586.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"586\" />\n\n&nbsp;",

Aviso was fortunate enough to land on this year’s <a href=\"https://www.g2crowd.com/best-software-companies/top-sales\">Top 50 Best Products for Sales</a> list for 2019, coming in at #47.

		"content": "There’s an incredible amount of excitement around us when it comes to AI. Consumer technology companies such as Google, Amazon, Uber, Netflix and Apple are using at AI at scale across every aspect of their business.\n\nOutside of a few examples B2B success adoption of AI by actual end users has been limited. We believe a huge part of the problem is that lots of companies with little to no AI under the hood have muddied the waters for buyers and users.\n\nAt Aviso we’ve been building, selling and implementing our AI for Sales platform for over five years. In those five years we’ve learned a lot about AI technology, and we’ve also learned lessons in how to implement and get end users to actively use AI technology. We've learnt two important things working with our Fortune 500 and high-growth customers.\n<blockquote><em>Number one: <strong>Accuracy is table stakes for users to embrace AI generated predictions </strong></em></blockquote>\nEnd users and buyers want to see proof and demonstrable benefits before they invest time and effort in a new tool. With AI, we ask our end users to trust the predictions and insights that come from the AI with hard proof of their accuracy. Although there’s also been an incredible amount of talk around enterprise AI , there has been precious little talk about <em>accuracy</em>.\n\nAt Aviso, we publish the results of our predictions for every quarter with our customers. In Q3 this year our WinScores had an average accuracy rate of <strong>92%</strong> and our aggregate AI Day 1 forecasts were <strong>91%</strong> accurate across our entire customer base.\n<blockquote>Number two follows: <strong>Predictions should be falsifiable and companies should publish how they fared</strong></blockquote>\nAviso bases all predictions on hypothesis that are falsifiable in principle and only makes claims when testing 100% false possibilities as not existent. None of the hundreds of players in Sales AI want to hold themselves to such a high bar because well, frankly, if a prediction didn't work out and no one heard about it, its ok right? WRONG. Predictions should be falsifiable.\n\nAt Aviso we continue to back test and provide our customers with full visibility into the accuracy of our predictions.\n\nRead our <a href=\"https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/12/19/1669459/0/en/Aviso-Achieves-Record-High-Accuracy-Rates-for-AI-powered-Sales-Predictions.html\">press release</a> here.",

		"content": "<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">How Dell, Splunk, Glassdoor, GitHub, RingCentral and Others Cracked The Code</h3>\n&nbsp;\n\nToday’s massive, complex sales organizations need to have the flexibility to see their quarterly and bi-quarterly forecasts in lots of different dimensions. In many cases they need to see their rollup forecast by product, region, geography, territory, sales VP, sales director AE, splits and more.\n\nThe primary problem is no CRM system on the market has the flexibility to create a customized multi-hierarchy forecast. Every CRM system has a basic hierarchy structure and these firms often try to convince global multinational companies to simplify their structure to fit into their solutions. In other words, change your business to fit their software.\n\nLarge, complex sales organizations cannot change how they need to report their forecasts to senior management, so they are forced to look outside of the CRM system. In the past, many gave up trying to get the CRM system to work and just decided to do it in spreadsheets. They created the monster spreadsheet of many tabs, versions, calculations, hedges, etc. Then, with one incorrect key stroke, the spreadsheet and projections tanked...the numbers they were rolling up were wrong. If they were one of the few that didn’t make spreadsheet errors, the sales operations team still had to deal with the heavy burden of maintaining the spreadsheet, emailing them around for updates, etc. and it all consumes a significant amount of time and a very negative effect on productivity.\n\nEnter the new age of AI-powered forecasting platforms. Companies like Aviso came to market to solve this huge problem. However, unlike Aviso, most of the platforms created their solution to mimic the sales organization and forecasting hierarchy structure in the CRM system. Hence most forecasting platforms can not truly address creative hierarchies and roll ups. They claim to be able to, but when they are asked to prove it, they fall short. They try to rely on the sizzle of their mobile applications, reporting and ease of data entry to change the rules of evaluation criteria. Savvy evaluation teams don’t let this happen. They put all the vendors to the test to prove it...as they should.\n\nSales and sales operations organizations need the flexibility of evaluating and forecasting their business from various views. How else can they see whether critical categories (regions, geographies, products, counties, etc.) are performing to plan? Businesses need the ability to analyze sales data and spot trends early in the quarter/sales cycle/ buyer journey so sales leaders can prioritize which opportunities need the most resource assistance from lead to close and which are on a path to landing successfully as planned.\n\nAviso clients minimize the surprises and close more deals in a more predictable manner. This ability to view the business along a number of hierarchies and pivots, all of which contribute to overall health of the business is a critical need for them. Combined with our AI for reliable aggregate and deal level forecasts, Aviso clients have created a unique competitive edge for themselves.\n\nLet us show you how your business can get that same powerful boost to your sales engine. And check out this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVn8CgXMZRI&amp;feature=youtu.be\">video</a> from Dana Therrien at SiriusDecisions as he explains how AI insights have helped eliminate the forecasting interrogation process and can provide a huge productivity improvement for sales teams.\n\nTo learn more, go to <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com\">Aviso.com</a>.",

		"content": "<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">AI for Sales. The future has never been brighter!</h3>\nIt was another amazing Dreamforce and I’m happy to say that the future of AI for sales looks brighter than ever! The heavy traffic at the Aviso booth reinforced my belief that sales people are beginning to adopt AI into their processes.\n\nArtificial Intelligence was a central theme at this year’s event and we were proud to be a Bronze Sponsor. We met a lot of people in the booth and discussed how our customers are leveraging AI to close more deals and drive better outcomes.\n\nWe learned a lot from the interactions we had, as well as in meetings with prospects and customers. Universally, it seems that there are a myriad of interesting sales challenges to overcome. Here are just a few:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Lack of visibility for managers and reps to accurately identify the best deals in their pipeline, preventing them from focusing their attention where it matters most</li>\n \t<li>Absence of actionable, data-driven insights to proactively guide decision-making</li>\n \t<li>Inability to accurately and predictably forecast using spreadsheets</li>\n</ul>\nAfter speaking with sales leaders, sales managers and sales operations professionals, from a diverse set of industries, the hurdles they faced were similar. And, although the concept of using AI to solve these challenges was new to many, they listened intently, asked the tough questions, and walked away with a new perspective on the power and benefits of applying AI to sales.\n\nWe really enjoyed co-hosting the lively Happy Hour event at the 3rd Street Taproom with Groove and Clearbit.  It was great to see so many customers and prospects enjoying the venue, as well as the great beer and wine selection.\n\nWe look forward to continuing the conversation with everybody we met. We’d like to learn more about your businesses so we can explore additional ways to solve your long-standing sales challenges with AI. We invite you to check out this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NODcwqy-ye4\">recent clip</a> of Jay Flanagan from Dell EMC as he discusses how their sales team is using Aviso's AI to become more focused and highlight the steps they need to take to close more deals.",

		"content": "Customer facing selling time is precious every quarter. Sales teams have to quickly determine which deals will close and can’t afford to spend a lot of time on ‘what if’ scenarios. Time is equally valuable on the Hubble Space Telescope. Every operational second is reserved months to years in advance. So, imagine the response when an astronomer proposed pointing Hubble at a seemingly empty patch of sky for 100 hours. His colleagues thought it a wasteful idea. \"We have so many things to do! There's no time! I've been doing this for 25 years! There's nothing to learn by trying that!\" were some of the objections.\n\nNevertheless, the team knew that they had never had such a powerful technology at their disposal. So they took a chance. The result? The discovery of 3,000 new galaxies in a tiny patch of sky.  The resulting image, known as Hubble Deep Field, has been called “the most important image ever taken” and has spawned new fields of research and transformed our understanding of the universe.\n\nFrom a data science perspective, the data from those galaxies has always existed in that “dark patch of sky”. Before Hubble, we simply never had the tools or technologies to even consider how staring at what appears to be empty space could literally shed light on something we simply couldn't see before.  Hubble's technology literally enabled us to see things we could never see with conventional tools.\n\nIn a similar manner, applying AI to CRM data and your sales processes provides sales teams and executive leadership insights into their performance they could never deduce with traditional transactional sales tools or methods. Aviso's customers analyze, interpret and score more opportunities faster than any other method. Our AI adjusts to the particular characteristics of your enterprise deals so your forecasts and opportunity reviews are tailored to <em>your</em> sales pipeline, products &amp; pricing.  We don't manipulate the data to make things look pretty. We analyze what's there to give you a predictable assessment of your likelihood of making your planned revenue forecast. And we can give you a 93% accurate forecast on the first day of the quarter.\n\nJust like Hubble, Aviso helps you spot data and trends in ways your existing sales tools simply can't. The result? Better sales pipeline discipline, allowing you and your teams to focus on the right deals and find those hidden 'galaxy' deals that are invisible without AI.  As one of our customers recently said, \"Aviso is part of the fabric of our forecasting process.\"\n\nDo you want to find those ‘hidden galaxy’ deals in your sales pipeline?  Call us today and we’ll show you how.",

		"image": "https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Webp.net-compress-image-7-300x181.jpg",
		"content": "For many B2B technology sales leaders, it’s “nail biting” time. Many of us have an April 30th quarter end and we’re all trying to close as much as we can to help make our forecasts and quotas.\n\nMuch of the outcome of the next few days will be achieved the old-fashioned way, with hard work, a lot of elbow grease and more than just a little too much “flying by the seat of our pants.” While that has served us well in the past we should, in this era of big data and AI, be applying more math to this traditional gut-wrenching process.\n\nFor quite a while now I’ve been working hard to incorporate more analytics into my traditional quarter-end processes. During my time at Google, as we scaled the Google Cloud business, we saw the need to apply data science to our process. Aviso is similar in that we’re dedicated to bringing data science to sales. So, from that perspective, let me offer some data driven insights that are broadly true in the B2B tech industry.\n\n<strong>First, the bad news.</strong>\n\nYou will close fewer deals in your commit and best-case pipeline than you think. We have scrubbed these pipelines, inspected the deals at a granular level and had sales reps and managers swear on a stack of bibles. But, the facts are pretty consistent, we will close fewer deals in the top forecast categories than we project we do. I’ve spoken with many an enterprise sales leader who swears that they will close 80-90% of the commit deals and 50% of the upside deals. My experience, and Aviso data, unfortunately do not bear those projections out, even with 1 week left to go in the quarter. We close fewer deals that are in commit and best-case than we predict.\n\n<strong>Now, some good news.</strong>\n\nYou will get some business from deals that are not in this quarter’s CRM. Many people will disagree here, but the data does not lie. First, deals will be pulled from future quarters into this quarter and secondly some deals will appear and close quickly. The quantity of the good news will depend on your mix of sales models and targets markets, but the facts once again do not lie, we tend to under predict in this area.\n\n<strong>Deal size is the wild card!</strong>\n\nYour forecast and attainment will also depend heavily on not only which deals close, but the size of those deals that close. It’s not an easy job to predict whether the prospect is buying the large, medium or small deal and we also have to predict the price and discount level to get this right. Even with the implementation of advanced CPQ systems, our discipline around projected deal size is not good.\n\n<strong>It’s not easy!</strong>\n\nClosing a quarter and accurately forecasting are not easy. You have to predict a lot of things like: 1) whether the customer will buy anything, 2) whether the customer will buy from you, 3) how much will the customer buy, 4) what price will the customer buy at and 5) when exactly will they buy. We also have to do this across a large portfolio of deals in various products, geographies and business segments. We, in sales, can do this the old-fashioned way with gut feel and a little bravado or we can leverage big data and AI to add to our intuition and experience to make the right calls.\n\nMy best wishes for a great quarter! If you’re interested in taking a more data-driven approach next quarter, drop me a line at michael@aviso.com. We’d be happy to analyze your data and let you know your historical close rates by forecast category and by week. This simple bit of insight could help make next quarter a little less nerve wracking than this one.",

Rao who also founded Zuora with Cheng Zou and Tien Tzuo in 2007.\n\nFounding a company with just an idea and a vision - powering the subscription economy- is an incredibly daunting and difficult task. Seeing Tien ring the opening bell at the NYSE with K.V. and Shasta partner Jason Pressman as well as Zuora’s President of Field Ops, Marc Diouane, is a motivational force for all of us here at Aviso. We know they have built a world class company that’s not only helping its customers, but fulfilling an important transformational role in our economy. People do not want to buy goods and services by paying for them upfront. We’d rather pay for them as we use them over time in a subscription model. Zuora has successfully enabled this shift for newer companies like Box, Zendesk and Docusign as well as traditional companies like CAT, Ford and GE as they make this monumental transition.\n\nWe are proud to have played a very small part in Zuora’s success story by enabling their sales leadership with AI-driven forecasting models and we look forward to seeing Zuora soar into the future.",

		"content": "Every year the popular crowd sourced review site G2 Crowd releases their new grid reports for the year summarizing vendor positions in each respective software category. This year Aviso was fortunate enough to land in the Leader quadrant for the newly anointed Sales Analytics Category for 2018. Please feel free to read the <a href=\"http://www.aviso.com/G2-CROWD-LEADER\">report here</a>.\n\nUp until mid-February Aviso had been listed in the Sales Intelligence Category, which is a very broad category including roughly 60 data services vendors like LinkedIn, D&amp;B, DiscoverOrg, Datahug and InsideSales.com to name just a few. The rollout of the Sales Analytics category earlier in the year was a very welcome development for us as it’s a much more concise grouping of similar vendors focused on software, as defined by G2, that “leverages CRM and other data to reveal sales insights and forecast future performance.”\n\nMaking it into the Leader quadrant is dependent on two factors: customer satisfaction (based on user reviews) and scale (based on market share, vendor size and social impact). We excelled in both of these areas and were able to see a 300% increase in our reviews since late December. We view candid user feedback as a great tool to help us to stay in closer contact with our customers and get up to speed on any trending issues or input.\n\nWe take customer reviews and product feedback very seriously here at Aviso. We respond rapidly to every negative, and in some cases even positive, reviews to ensure we maintain a feedback loop and provide relevant, actionable feedback for our unbiased reviewers. In my few short months here at Aviso I’ve been impressed with the shared level of effort to quickly and collaboratively solve customer issues and I continue to be committed to working across all lines of business to strengthen these relationships.\n\nNowadays, just like the technology buying cycle, companies are educating themselves via digital platforms like G2 Crowd to become familiar with the leading vendors in each category and begin assessing vendor fit for their companies based on a number of important factors. To that end, these sites are becoming the de facto “one stop shop” for many leading companies to objectively evaluate tech vendors.\n\nIn case you missed it, here’s what our customers are saying about us:\n\n“Aviso's predictive forecast is deadly accurate for RingCentral's high transaction business.”\n\n“When we put in our target, we can see whether we are going to make it or not. Then we have 89 days to influence the number and make up any potential gaps.”\n\n“My favorite part of Aviso is the ability to drill down into the forecast and be able to see exactly what deals make up that forecast.”\n\n<a href=\"http://www.aviso.com/G2-CROWD-LEADER\">Read more here. </a>",

		"content": "In a recent Harvard Business Review Analytic Services study titled “Artificial Intelligence for Maximizing Revenue,” HBR surveyed 490 executives and managers. Of the hundreds of leaders surveyed, approximately 60% said they believe their future success depends on the successful implementation of artificial intelligence.\n\nAmong this group, 36% said their organizations were in pilot or production use with machine learning technology. According to HBR’s study, companies that commit to effectively adopting these capabilities are expected to achieve significant competitive advantages in revenue generation.\n\nSalesforce released similar results in their special report “The AI Revolution.” After surveying approximately 10,800 sales, service, and marketing leaders and over 7,000 consumers and business buyers, they found a “growing eagerness to capitalize on the opportunities AI presents.” According to their findings, 37% of teams are already using AI, and a further 22% are piloting or evaluating solutions.\n\nAdditionally, the Salesforce report finds that top sales teams are more likely to leverage AI. High-performing teams, which are defined as those teams who have significantly increased their YoY revenue growth, are 3.1x more likely than their underperforming counterparts to use AI currently, or plan to use it in the future.\n\nBoth studies suggest that we can expect a business world powered by AI. At Aviso, we also see AI for sales having a major impact on the B2B high tech enterprise.\n<h4>AI is Sales People's New Best Friend</h4>\nApplying AI to the sales processes most closely connected to revenue is gaining attention. Our customers - top performing sales teams in B2B tech - are leveraging AI to deliver accurate forecasts, move pipeline faster, and close more deals.\n\nFor us, harnessing the power of AI is about enabling humans (not replacing them) with the data they need, so that they can do the things they're uniquely good at and take informed action. We help guide their decisions with data and insights the human brain alone could never detect.\n\nHumans simply aren’t capable of digesting the amount of data we’re collecting, making sense of it, or detecting meaningful patterns. We snapshot the data in CRM systems, including custom fields, store eight quarters worth of data, and analyze millions of predictive signals to surface insights and predictions. We then back test to validate our findings.\n\nThe payoff, is that sales and finance people gain the ability to make data-driven decisions that drive revenue. With AI, workflows become simple, intuitive and driven by data, rather than human judgment alone.\n<h4>Sales people are betting on AI.</h4>\nLearn how you can use AI for sales to transform your sales organization.\n\nAI-POWERED FORECASTING: <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/aviso-forecasting-guide-031218-B.pdf\">See the step-by-step workflow used by sales leaders to deliver accurate forecasts</a>.\n\nAI-POWERED PIPELINE REVIEWS: <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/aviso-pipeline-guide-020118-2-1.pdf\">See the step-by-step workflow used by high performing sales teams to move pipeline faster.</a>\n\nAI-POWERED DEAL REVIEWS: <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/aviso-deal-review-guide-040218.pdf?submissionGuid=9057d5cd-e19b-4f29-9d3a-7c36670deeb8\">View the step-by-step workflow used by sales leaders to close more deals</a>.\n\n&nbsp;",

		"title": "CRO's and CFO's - New Best Friends",
		"image": "https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/unnamed-1-300x200.jpg",
		"content": "<h4>In many industries, the chief revenue officer (CRO), also known as the VP of worldwide sales, and the chief financial officer (CFO) are typically not the best of friends. This isn’t great, because these two roles need to get along for companies to thrive and succeed in a competitive marketplace. In fact, in healthy companies, the CFO and the CRO are best friends.</h4>\n<h2>Understanding the CFO Job Function</h2>\nWhy does conflict exist between the people who hold these roles? We can begin to see where things go awry by examining the job function of the CFO, who is accountable to the CEO for financially planning most aspects of the company. He or she needs to provide accurate projections to the board and shareholders, execute cash management, and create quarterly and annual top- and bottom-line plans.\n\nWhat often gets in the way of planning and budgeting is the inability of the sales organization to accurately forecast revenue for the quarter (never mind forecasting two quarters out).\n\nBecause arriving at an accurate forecast is essential for the CFO’s job function, often the CFO will listen in on sales forecast calls to get a sense of quarterly progress. One of the biggest complaints from CFOs is that, while they feel the sales team has a reliable outlook on some of the quarter’s pipeline, there are often blind spots that come from heavy reliance on gut feel and human intuition. These blind spots lead to missed forecasts, which reduces the CFO’s confidence in the numbers the sales team delivers.\n<h2>When Sales Forecasting Questions Go Unanswered</h2>\nIt’s understandable why the CFO would want to be involved in the forecasting process; however, friction can arise when unsolicited advice is given on how to execute deals.\n\nAdditionally, CFOs will often ask the following basic and valid questions the sales team can’t easily answer.\n\n<strong>“What changed in the forecast since last week?”</strong>\n<strong> “How much business do you expect to pop up and close in-quarter?”</strong>\n<strong> “How are you doing versus this time last year or this time last quarter?”</strong>\n<strong> “What pacing of deals closing do you need throughout the quarter to make the number?”</strong>\n\nOn many levels, it’s no longer acceptable for the sales team not to have this information at their fingertips.\n<h2>The Problem with Spreadsheets and CRM Reports</h2>\nThe problem is, the majority of sales teams are still using spreadsheets and CRM reports, which makes obtaining historical information, making predictions, and detecting trends difficult. A complicated spreadsheet is simply a compilation of what is in CRM along with gut and intuition. The more the sales leader relies on spreadsheets and gut, the more he or she loses credibility with the CFO and CEO.\n\nThere is a better way.\n\nWith the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning for revenue-generating sales processes such as forecasting, the CFO, and senior sales executives are more aligned than ever.\n\nThrough AI-based sales planning and forecasting, sales executives can let data drive the conversation. For example, a sales executive can now leverage a trend line of closing business to prove that his or her team will exceed plan by the end of the quarter. Additionally, they can back up their intuition on close date with AI-driven smart selling signals that show which deals are most likely to close this quarter, push into next quarter, or be lost opportunities.\n<h2>The Difference AI Makes: Achieving Accurate Sales Forecasts</h2>\nWith AI projections, on the first day of the quarter, sales executives can tell the CFO with 90-95 percent accuracy what the end-of-quarter number will be... AND where they will land next quarter!\n\nAdditionally, with an AI-enabled platform, sales executives can now tell the CFO what business will close that wasn’t in the pipeline at the beginning of the quarter.\n\nWith confidence in the forecast, the CFO can plan, put hiring models in place, execute spending to meet cash flow objectives, and – lo and behold – create an annual bookings plan that is based on reliable data vs. the growth rate they want to achieve for the next round of funding or pleasing shareholders.\n\nA note of caution: Unless sales execs become more analytical using accurate, predictable data, they will be marginalized by other departments – not viewed as a data-driven sales executive. Make the transition from reliance on gut, intuition, and spreadsheets to a new era of AI-generated insights. The sales executive graveyard of those who haven’t embraced the science of selling continues to grow. Don’t be one of them.\n\nBy introducing them to these technologies, Aviso has already turned CFOs and sales executives into best friends at many high-tech companies.",

		"content": "Wow.  It’s been a great year at Aviso.  Not an easy one, but a year of significant growth and progress. I want to thank all of our customers, our partners and our employees for their trust, dedication and hard work.\n\nAviso exists solely to help our customers grow their businesses faster through the use of Artificial Intelligence in Sales. Applying AI to Sales is an idea that our Founders envisioned 4 years ago and after living on the bleeding edge for a while, the idea is now becoming mainstream.\n\nWe at Aviso are proud of our accomplishments in several key areas.\n<h3><strong>We Grew Customer Growth and Adoption.</strong></h3>\nAviso achieved triple digit growth as our existing customers expanded and deepened their use of AI in their organizations. Companies like RingCentral, Splunk and Apttus embraced the use of AI at an even deeper level than ever and have made Aviso an important part of their sales process.\n\nWe added some exciting new customers to the Aviso platform in 2017.  They range from one of the largest multinational technology companies in the world to newly public companies like MongoDB to fast growing private companies like Elastic and Mesosphere.\n\nOur customers not only use AI for Sales forecasting, Aviso’s traditional strength, but also to drive big improvements in their pipeline management and deal review processes.\n<h3><strong>We Expanded our Product Line.</strong></h3>\nOur product and engineering teams had a milestone year. We overhauled our flagship forecasting product with an brand new UI and an enhanced mobile app, AvisoGo.  We deepened our forecasting capabilities and introduced three completely new modules: Pipeline management, Deal Review and Sales Visibility.  We also infused each of these modules with unique capabilities that leverage the largest and most comprehensive time series database in the industry.\n<h3><strong>We Extended our AI Leadership.</strong></h3>\nIt’s become very popular for legacy technology vendors to rebrand their products with the AI label by slapping a logo on their homepage. Aviso was born as an AI company and 40% of our engineering team is dedicated solely to data science. That team had a tremendous year. They were not content to sit on the laurels of our industry leading forecasting algorithms.\n\nThey deepened and expanded these algorithms while shipping breakthrough AI features that include: a Predictive Pipeline Valuator, a Pipeline Change Analytics feature set, an AI-based Sales Pacing Model, enhanced AI-based Deal Insights and richer Deal Score Explanations within our industry leading deal scoring technology. Each of these features bring unparalleled new insights to sales management and sales leaders.\n\nFinally, our AI-based algorithms have consumed over 5 million live sales opportunities and that volume continues to improve accuracy on a daily basis. Furthermore, in 2017 our algorithms generated 1.3 million hours of CPU usage to produce our customers predictions.\n<h3><strong>We Expanded our Partner Network.</strong></h3>\nWe have always had a great partnership with Salesforce. You can find our products in the AppExchange and we are members of their ISV program. We work closely with their product teams to ensure maximum levels of integration, and you will also find us on the Dreamforce floor as well as blazing a trail as a sponsor of Salesforce World Tour events.\n\nWe also began working more closely last year with Microsoft and Oracle, and are committed to partnering with them to bring the benefits of AI to their respective customer bases.\n\nWe also announced a robust Global Partner Program and a new set of open APIs that will allow other sales tech vendors to easily integrate with Aviso.\n<h3><strong>We Grew our Team.</strong></h3>\nIn addition to growing in the above areas, Aviso also grew as a company. We added new executive talent in Sales, Business Development, Product Management, Engineering and Marketing, from industry leaders like Zuora, Jive, Oracle, Salesforce, Deloitte and SugarCRM.  Our USA headcount grew by over 20% and we also made large and continued investments in our Aviso India corporation in Hyderabad.\n\n2017 was a milestone year for Aviso with a ton of progress but I feel our work has just begun. AI is transforming our lives as consumers and the B2B application of AI is now becoming mainstream. We won’t rest until all sales reps, first line sales managers, sales operations and sales leaders are armed with the most advanced AI-driven forecasting solution on the market.\n\nStay tuned. There’s a lot more to come in 2018 and we are excited to continue on this highly rewarding journey with you all!",

		"image": "https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/shutterstock_616247645-300x200.jpg",
		"content": "Make no mistake, revenue growth is directly impacted by the frequency, approach, and quality of your pipeline management -- and your sales pipeline review is key to navigating the process.\n\nA recent study conducted by the Sales Management Association found that sales teams at B2B enterprise companies who spend at least three hours per month talking with each sales rep about their pipeline had 11% greater growth.\n\nThe two main indicators of a successful sales pipeline review are:\n<ul>\n \t<li>the ability to drive adequate pipeline coverage, and</li>\n \t<li>ensuring that deals are progressing at a healthy clip.</li>\n</ul>\nThese are fundamentally important to driving revenue. Because this process was so central to the sales team, we wanted to know how happy salespeople were with their current review process.\n\nWhat we found out is the majority of sales teams have been using the same tools for 20+ years. These teams also admit that, with their current method, deals often slipped through the cracks.\n<h2><strong>What's wrong with CRM reports and spreadsheets?</strong></h2>\nIf you’re like most sales teams in B2B tech organizations, you export CRM data into a spreadsheet in preparation for a meeting on your sales pipeline review. First, you sort deals by forecast category and then sub-sort them by deal size. Then, reps and managers sit down together, start at the top of the list and work their way to the bottom, reviewing each deal.\n\nPlodding your way down a spreadsheet is problematic for two main reasons:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Deals with large amounts and deals that fall into the best case and commit category are generally reviewed during typical deal review meetings. </strong>The top-down method employed by most teams focuses primarily on deals at the end of the sales process. Not enough time is spent reviewing the status of mid-funnel deals or talking through new pipeline generation.</li>\n \t<li><strong>You can’t see what changed since last week.</strong> This lack of visibility makes it difficult to assess progress.</li>\n</ol>\nThere is a better way, and it involves generating revenue through the use of AI.\n\nRight about now, most of you are thinking:\n<h2><strong>Do I really need to apply AI to my sales pipeline reviews? </strong></h2>\n<strong>The answer is YES. Here's why.</strong>\n\nHigh-performing sales teams — those driving significant revenue growth — are applying AI to sales processes mostly closely connected to revenue generation, including pipeline reviews, forecasting, and deal reviews.\n\nAccording to Salesforce’s Special Report titled “The AI Revolution,” there’s a clear relationship between early adoption of AI and future success. Sales teams who have significantly increased their YoY revenue growth are <strong>3.1x more likely</strong> than their underperforming counterparts — those with negative YoY revenue growth — to use AI currently, or plan to do so within a year.\n\n<strong>Why are sales teams adopting AI-driven technology? Because AI can provide personalized, meaningful insights that actually move the needle in sales cycles.</strong>\n<h2><strong>What information about my sales pipeline review can AI-driven technology provide that I can’t get with CRM data and spreadsheets?</strong></h2>\nGlad you asked!

		"title": "FAKE NEWS: Do Your Forecasts Qualify?",
		"image": "https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shutterstock_587734298-300x184.jpg",
		"content": "Across the tech industry, on either Mondays or Fridays, sales executives are typically consumed with lengthy forecasting calls. Just about every sales leader spends too many hours doing top-down forecast calls, and along with his or her sales operations partner, plugs notes and numbers into their forecast spreadsheets.\n\nAfter hours of phone conversations listening to the status of deals and updating their spreadsheets, sales leaders have to present to the executive team the updated forecast and discuss the most critical deals for the quarter.\n\nWhile senior sales leaders have great deal instincts, can quickly sniff out b.s. from their AE, and demand that their team “net out” their deal status talk track, the current forecasting process is extremely inefficient, and inadvertently perpetuates “fake news” cycles.\n\nMost reps are integrating their version of the truth with the facts of the deals. The problem is, their version of the truth is often not completely accurate. According to CSO Insights, 48% of sales people surveyed reported that they were accurate only half of the time when predicting deal amounts and close date time frames. This means that human judgment alone is no more accurate than simply tossing a coin.\n\nEvery sales cycle is a culmination of hundreds of events, data elements, activities, etc. While we summarize our selling processes into stages, it is hundreds of variables that come together to determine a deal’s fate. If you rely on spreadsheets, experience and human-based intuition, you’ll miss critical trends of similar deals, and not see a true picture of the forecast or the pipeline. This results in inaccurate forecasts and projections to the leadership team, misguided expectations, and a lot of invested time that could be better spent discussing deal strategy.\n\nThe solution lies in applying AI and machine learning to current and historical CRM data. In fact, in a recent study conducted by Harvard Business Review, more than 60% of sales executives surveyed reported that their future success depends on successfully adopting AI.\n\nOf course, there are always objections. Sales leaders have often asked the value of applying machine learning models to “dirty” or inaccurate data. The reality is that AI helps sales teams clean up their data and guides them to improve their accuracy over time.\n\nCase in point, we have a client that was nervous about the data their sales team was putting in to their CRM, fearing that sales people were unknowingly entering “fake news” about their deals. Here’s what happened: our models identified where there were likely inaccuracies, provided suggested adjustments and projected that they would close 33 more deals than expected. At the end of the quarter, they indeed closed 33 more deals.Trying to make sense of all the data you are managing in spreadsheets and the “fake news” being inadvertently reported by the sales team will kill the career of any sales executive. Leveraging AI-powered predictions to guide human judgment enables more accurate forecasts, improves commit accuracy and enables the delivery of reliable forecasts to the executive team.\n\nThere’s enough fake news out there. Let AI be the game changer that provides guidance and keeps your team honest and on track.",

		"title": "Moneyball: How to be the Billy Beane of Sales",
		"image": "https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Moneyball2.jpg",
		"content": "Major league baseball and sales organizations have something very much in common. Sure, the competitiveness of sales professionals can rival that of professional athletes, but what I’m referring to is the need for data.\n\nIn 2003, Michael Lewis wrote the bestselling book, Moneyball. Some of you may have read the book, others may have seen the movie starring Brad Pitt as Billy Beane. Both tell the fascinating story of how major league baseball evolved from an old fashioned, stodgy kind of business, to one driven by data and statistics.\n\nUp until the mid 1990s baseball was run by scouts, field managers and general managers who were old time baseball people - mostly ex-players from the minor and major leagues. This self admitted “crusty” crew drafted players, and made game execution decisions based on gut, intuition, experience and personal bias. None of the decisions were based off of metrics like on base percentage, total walks, slugging percentage, etc.\n\nFast forward to today. The most successful teams use guidance from saber-metrics, big data and AI to complement human judgment. Analytics now drive draft picks, trades, lineup and any other major decisions. For the latest evidence of this approach, look no further than the 2017 World Series winning Houston Astros. They successfully transformed their team (business) blending the latest in data analytics with great talent.\n\nJust about every major league team has a GM that is a maven at data analytics supported by computer modeling. Today, pitchers are drafted by analyzing factors that include maximum external rotation, arm position at foot contact, knee bend at ball release, because they have a direct coloration to injury probability and performance.\n\nWhat does this have to do with running a high performance sales organization?\n\nWhen it comes to key deal management processes, the majority of sales organizations operate like the old stodgy scouts and GMs of baseball’s yesterday. Most rely on the art of the sell, using gut feel and intuition.\n<h2>There’s very little data that takes into account historical performance or seasonality being used to guide forecast management, pipeline reviews, or deal reviews.</h2>\nPreparing for each of these meetings can be time consuming, and with gut feeling driving decisions, leadership isn’t able to get an accurate picture of the business.\n\nSure, data from CRM systems is useful, but most sales organizations have yet to adopt advanced, cloud-based technology or machine learning to assist their teams. Instead, managers ask questions of their reps, assess their truthfulness, integrate involvement with the deals, come up with a swag or confidence level of a forecast number, and predict which deals will close, for how much, and when.\n\nI suggest that, like major league baseball, it’s time for us to transition to leveraging the power of big data, machine learning and AI to drive decision making for forecast management, deal reviews, and weekly pipeline calls. I have been leading organizations and sales teams for over 30 years, and I too am one of those leaders that had to come to this realization and adjust.\n\nWe’ve entered into the new era of the AI-driven sales organization. Like financial planning, supply chain management and so many other business processes, shouldn’t sales organizations leverage machine learning and AI to create more accurate forecasts? Don’t our CEOs, CFOs and shareholders deserve a more accurate forward-looking assessment of the business by leveraging predictions based on several quarters of data pulled from CRM and other sales systems?\n\nIt is time for sales organizations to enter the Moneyball era and stop using bulky, error prone spreadsheets as a forecasting tool, or as a tool to run pipeline reviews. Aviso can help you do this. Unlike CRM analytics, spreadsheets, or simple forecasting tools, our platform connects to CRM systems, snapshots data every 15 minutes, and stores it in the independent data store. We see through millions of data points, to make sense of predictive signals and provide a series of accurate predictions on day one of the quarter.\n\nWe recognize that sales data is generated within several technologies that are resident in the sales stack, and we also leverage this data within our AI algorithms, to provide deal views and forecasting information you haven’t had before.\n<h2>Another thing you can do with AI is understand if you’re closing deals fast enough to hit quota, known as “pacing.” You’ll also be able to determine if your current pipeline will produce enough revenue to meet quota this quarter, and whether pipeline is being built and progressed at the proper pace to support next quarter’s number.</h2>\nFinally, through the power of machine learning, you can get an accurate sense of your run rate business, or the amount of revenue you can expect from deals that both open and close in-quarter.\n\nWouldn’t it be helpful to know if a rep, product line or business segment is forecasted to miss the number, by how much and what to do about it, all while driving smart pipeline management and deal reviews? With AI for deal management, you can do that.\n\nSimilar to professional sports, you have great talent on your team. You have sales pros that are proficient at selling and negotiating. Now, you can use AI to guide your talent to better assess the likelihood deals will close and forecast more accurately. You can also stay laser focused on deals that need immediate attention during pipeline reviews, and eliminate any prep required for deal reviews.\n\nIt’s time to be a fully data-driven organization.

		"content": "Spreadsheet blunders have cost companies millions. Studies have shown that <span style=\"color: #b32e61;\"><a style=\"color: #b32e61;\" href=\"http://panko.shidler.hawaii.edu/SSR/Mypapers/whatknow.htm\">90% of spreadsheets contain errors</a>.</span> Clearly, spreadsheet forecasts can't possibly be reliable -- so why are so many B2B tech companies still relying on a clunky combination of CRM reports and spreadsheets to produce their forecasts?\n\nSales forecasting is one of the single most important processes at any B2B company. The number that the sales team delivers drives a series of other critical processes -- from resource allocation, inventory planning, attracting investors, to reporting out to the street. Yet, companies still rely on largely outdated tools, which can pose great risks.\n\nHere are the top five dangers of using spreadsheet forecasts to drive your revenue strategy.\n<h4><strong>1. Human Bias in Spreadsheet Forecasts Can Easily Introduce Million Dollar Data Entry Errors that Compromise Accuracy.</strong></h4>\nAs your organization grows, spreadsheets naturally become more complex. Over time, formula and data entry errors will inevitably creep into your spreadsheets, which severely and materially impact forecast accuracy.\n\nTogether, accounting for spilt deals, currency conversions, and sales crediting issues makes data entry mistakes common.\n\nAdditionally, errors will creep into the spreadsheet as the sales organization changes. Spreadsheets are often designed to handle a specific organizational rollup. But sales reps churn, and new reps and overlays are added.\n\nMatrix organizations become common, and spreadsheets are slow to adapt. This results in duplicate deals or numbers, which can easily ruin the integrity of your data. As staff turns over, spreadsheet maintenance becomes increasingly difficult.\n\n<strong>The result:</strong>\nIt’s happened to all of us -- it only takes one formula or data entry error to completely throw off your entire spreadsheet forecast and erode the credibility of your sales and sales ops team.\n<h4><strong>2. Forecast Numbers Constantly Change, Making Spreadsheets Quickly out of Date, and Leading to Arguments Over the Data. </strong></h4>\nMore often than not, the latest data entered into CRM is not reflected in your spreadsheets. We estimate that 99% of the time, these two tools are out of sync.\n\nWe understand that businesses use spreadsheet forecasts to augment their CRM data. Most CRM systems lack strong forecasting modules. Alone, they can only leverage single point in time data and are unable to employ multiple forecast views across different business pivots, as is needed for 360 degree visibility.\n\n<strong>The result:</strong>\nSpreadsheets are generally updated once per week with data from CRM systems, so the minute reps change a deal status or forecast, the spreadsheet becomes out-of-date. Since spreadsheets often contain stale data, this leads to a lot of time wasted arguing over numbers, and takes time away from coaching and more strategic deal-level discussion.\n<h4><strong>3. Sales Ops Wastes Hours Per Week Working on Spreadsheets Rather than More Strategic Activities.</strong></h4>\nA vast amount of time is spent collating, maintaining, and verifying data in spreadsheets. Excel spreadsheets were not designed to do large collaborative projects, so typically sales operations will build multiple spreadsheets that are then distributed, copied, and used. Here's the problem: version control can become a big issue. Sales ops must distribute, then collate, check and often re-enter information into a master spreadsheet that becomes the official forecast.\n\nIn organizations with multiple levels, the problem is amplified. Each level of the organization adds their own judgment to the forecast, and Sales Operations must repeat the process of re-collating, re-checking and re-entering data in multiple master spreadsheets to inform their forecasts.\n\n<strong>The result:</strong>\nSales Operations is faced with the unenviable task of accurately rolling up an accurate spreadsheet forecast in a short period of time with a system that is inherently unstable. Your team ends up wasting time that could otherwise be spent on more strategic activities such as pipeline and territory reviews.\n<h4><strong>4. Spreadsheet Forecasts Provide Very Limited Visibility into Revenue, and Fail to Help You Answer Basic Sales Questions.</strong></h4>\nIn the hybrid CRM and spreadsheet combination, the CRM holds detailed data on deals and pipelines, while the spreadsheet forecast holds prediction summaries and historical information. Since the two systems are not synced, you cannot drill down into the forecast to see what deals make up the forecast. This process is further complicated by the judgment added by each level of sales management.\n\n<strong>The result:</strong>\n\nYou’re unable to see which deals are impacting your forecast. You can’t see judgment applied across the hierarchy. Answering routine and frequently asked questions is next to impossible. How do you know if a deal is in or out of the forecast? What changed between forecasts? Most importantly, why?\n\nUltimately, spreadsheet forecasts cannot provide you with the visibility you need to run your business or the forecast call.\n<h4><strong>5. Spreadsheet Forecasts Cannot Offer Predictive Insight.</strong></h4>\nLeading sales organizations now leverage big data and AI for predictive forecasting, but the existing CRM/ spreadsheet system lacks meaningfulpredictive insight. Spreadsheet forecasts can contain only summary-level information and CRM systems keep limited historical data that machine learning algorithms would need to make AI-based predictions.\n\n<strong style=\"font-size: 1em;\">The result:</strong><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">\n</span>You’re unable to leverage your historical data to gain insights into how your quarter will unfold or see an objective AI forecast for comparison against your team's predictions.\n\nForecasting must be modernized. Using single-point CRM reports and outdated spreadsheets cannot be the future. Early adopters such as <span style=\"color: #b32e61;\"><a style=\"color: #b32e61;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/customers/\">Xactly, Splunk and Apttus</a></span> have moved to a cloud-based forecasting tool, which delivers the following benefits:\n<ul>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-size: 1em; text-indent: -1.5em;\">Automates the rollup to eliminate spreadsheets and the errors that come along with them</span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-size: 1em; text-indent: -1.5em;\">Enables multiple forecast views with the click of a button, giving you a 360-degree view</span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-size: 1em; text-indent: -1.5em;\">Has a deal-level forecasting feature that shows which deals are in and out of forecast</span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-size: 1em; text-indent: -1.5em;\">Provides the ability to drill down into the deals making up your forecasts</span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-size: 1em; text-indent: -1.5em;\">Provides visibility into deal-level detail and judgment applied across every level of the organization</span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-size: 1em; text-indent: -1.5em;\">Keeps a complete history of every deal, pipeline, and forecast so that machine learning models can be used to do predictive forecasting\n</span></li>\n \t<li>Syncs with your CRM for real-time data that is always up-to-date<span style=\"font-size: 1em; font-weight: 600; text-indent: -1.5em;\">\n</span></li>\n \t<li>And more.</li>\n</ul>\nYou deserve better than high-risk, low-reward spreadsheet forecasts.  See how 98% accurate, AI-powered forecasting can help your business scale.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[button link=\"#https://www.aviso.com/contact-us/\" type=\"big\" color=\"red\" newwindow=\"yes\"] <span style=\"color: #ffffff;\"><b>Schedule a Demo </b></span>[/button]</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

		"image": "https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shutterstock_298037282-1.jpg",
		"content": "As a Sales Manager, you’re essentially being asked to predict the future.\n\nThe CRO or VP of Sales want to know when deals are going to close and for how much. You’re being asked to know how much pipeline you need to make or exceed quota and how many “blue birds” you can expect to pop up and close in quarter.\n\nHow do you do this now? Gut feeling? Experienced guessing? Crystal ball?\n\nThere’s no longer any need to guess. Next generation tools provide you with accurate early quarter predictions and actionable insight. You need more than just another tool that shows you sales results. You need predictions and forecasts early in the quarter, so that you can take control of team performance.\n\nSales Managers using Aviso Sales Vision do just that. They leverage the ASV platform to arm themselves with the data they need to take action and drive results.\n\n<strong>Here are four pieces of AI-driven information that they have, and you don’t:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Which deals impact their forecast</li>\n \t<li>How much run rate business to expect</li>\n \t<li>If the team is on track to hit quota</li>\n \t<li>The value of the deals in their pipeline</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>1.</strong> <strong>They know why their forecast changed and specifically which deals they need to fix to fix the forecast. </strong>Sales managers using Aviso know which deals their reps are counting on for the quarter, and what changed at the deal level between any two points in time that caused their forecast to go up or down.\n\n<strong>Business Impact: </strong>In order to take action, you need to know which deals impacted your forecast. To obtain that information now, most likely you have Sales Operations run a report. Aviso Sales Managers, on the other hand, have granular visibility and drill down capability into what changed in their forecast and why.\n\n<img class=\" wp-image-3849 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Sales-Operations-Image-2-Forecast-300x195.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"402\" height=\"261\" />\n\nUnlike a weather forecast, with Aviso Sales Vision, Sales Managers don’t cancel their picnic when rain (or missed quota) is expected. Instead, they help change the outcome. They focus on deals that are at-risk, and take control of their quarterly result.\n\n<img class=\" wp-image-3850 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Sales-Operations-Image-5-Insights-300x195.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"403\" height=\"262\" />\n\nEmail us at <a href=\"mailto:sales@aviso.com\">sales@aviso.com</a> to find out how only we can tell you which deals impacted your forecast.\n\n<strong>2.</strong> <strong>They know how much revenue they can attribute to run rate business. </strong>Whether your business is transactional or long tail, a significant portion of revenue can be attributed to run rate deals, or opportunities that enter the pipeline and close in the quarter. Aviso Sales Managers, even those focused on enterprise deals, know that a surprising amount of revenue (up to 40%) comes from this chunk of business.\n\n<strong>Business Impact:</strong> Having visibility into how much of your business comes from short sales cycles versus longer ones drives both sales strategy and sales coaching. Want to increase your run rate business in a particular region? Put more marketing dollars into campaigns to drive inbound leads. Also, know whether your team is good at opening new business, or whether certain reps need coaching on converting leads to opportunities.\n\n<strong>3. They know if their team is on track to make their number</strong> — before it’s too late in the quarter to make a difference. How do you currently answer the question “How are we doing this quarter?” Most likely you give a vague answer such as “Looking good, but it all depends on the final month.” Sales Managers use Aviso Sales Vision to give precise updates. They know if they’re 3% ahead of expected closure or 41% behind pace. They avoid surprises, because they’re armed with pacing insight all quarter long.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Business Impact: </strong>You can use your spreadsheet or a simple forecasting tool to see how much business you’ve closed to date, but that still doesn’t tell you whether you’re ahead or behind where you need to be. Knowledge is power. Know exactly where you stand, and take appropriate action if your team isn’t closing deals fast enough to hit quota.\n\n<strong>4. They know if they have enough pipe to meet next quarter goals. </strong>Sales Managers using the Aviso Pipeline Value Predictor know how much pipeline they’ll need to hit goals up to 180 days in the future. They also know how much revenue will be generated from the deals in their current pipeline.\n\n<img class=\" wp-image-3851 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Sales-Operations-Image-3-Pipeline--300x195.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"402\" height=\"262\" />\n\n<strong>Business Impact: </strong>Almost every missed quota can be traced back to one fundamental problem: not having enough pipeline. We set you up for success every quarter because you know how much coverage you need to hit your goal, and you can see whether lack of pipeline is due to a sales prospecting issue, or if you need to work more closely with marketing to generate leads.\n\nIn summary, we give you the insight and visibility to need to answer a very powerful question: <strong>How much revenue can I expect in the next six months and what’s standing in my way of achieving my goal?</strong>\n\nGet the AI-powered insight you need to hit quota, and be a successful Sales Manager (and soon to be Director), this quarter and next.",

		"title": "Sales Forecasting: Four Things You Can No Longer Get Away With in Today’s Data-Driven World",
		"image": "",
		"content": "<b>1) Telling the Boss that “Forecasting is an Art”</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my previous life, when asked for my forecast, I tried to convince my boss that while sales was certainly not a science, I alone had the black magic secrets to getting our forecast right. I knew my reps and managers well, and could use my excellent judgment to account for both sandbaggers and the overly optimistic. My spreadsheet was an all-telling oracle of knowledge that enabled me to determine the real time status of the business.</span>\n\nThis approach no longer flies in the world of AI and big data. Running on gut instinct and hunches alone doesn’t provide the accuracy needed to build confidence. Every aspect of life and business is being “money balled” right now, and the forecast is no different.\n\nHeck, even the Cubs won the world series by hiring a data guy!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>2) Delivering the First forecast AFTER the QBR </b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you can believe it, we would deliver our first real bottoms-up forecast weeks into the quarter, after our Quarterly Business Review. At QBR, all the reps presented their pipelines and opportunities for the quarter and sales management asked questions in order to “scrub the pipeline” before submitting its first real forecast. If we were asked for a forecast before the QBR, we would submit a low confidence estimate based on historical results. We told peers and executives that we couldn’t provide an accurate forecast since the CRM data wasn’t cleaned up, and a thorough scrub of all deals would be coming in week 3 of the quarter.</span>\n\nIf you’re still doing it this way, it’s time to kill the QBR as a forecasting method. You simply can’t wait until the quarter is 25% done to get a handle on things. By then it’s often too late to take any real action to affect the quarter.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>3) Using the 3X Pipeline Rule to Forecast Future Quarters</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m not sure how the “3X pipeline coverage” myth started, but we know that it cannot be universally true. First, with this method, each dollar of pipeline is treated the same. We know this is a flawed concept. Deals in later stages of the pipeline are more valuable than those in the early stage. Deals for proven products are more valuable than those for unproven products. Deals in industries where we have proven use cases are more valuable than deals in industries where we have few customers. We know giving equal weight to each deal in the pipeline is wrong, but we do it anyway. </span>\n\nSecond, it fails to acknowledge differences in deal types in our pipeline. We know that upsell deals closer faster and more reliably than new business deals, but we again treat them the same. Third, large deals tend to cloud our view of the pipeline. We use the large $1M type deals to convince ourselves that our pipeline is OK, when we know that the large deals are inherently risky, take longer to close and often close for lower amounts.\n\nFourth, standard 3X pipeline coverage rules do not take“run rate,” or deals that enter the pipeline and close in the same quarter, into account. As the industry trends to include more land and expand deals and more mid market and SMB, we’re seeing a higher percentage of run rate business. As that trend becomes more prominent, it will clearly affect the pipeline that is needed at the beginning of quarter.\n\nWe need better analysis and algorithms to calculate needed pipeline. The tools are there for us to do this, and we need to start using them.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>4) Thinking the Weekly Forecast is Over When You Send “the Number” Upstairs</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, when we finished the weekly pipeline review and scrubbed the forecast, we sent the number upstairs and headed to the bar with the reps to “keep them motivated.” Today the forecast is not the end of the process, it’s the beginning. Yes the forecast needs to be set upstairs so that the executive team knows what to expect. The CFO needs to ensure that we are matching expense to revenues, but in today’s world that not enough.</span>\n\nIf leveraged correctly, the data-driven forecast is the real-time dashboard that tells you where your business stands. If you are doing it properly, it will give you all the insights that you need to fix problems or take advantage of opportunities. If one region is doing well, they may need more reps to exploit the opportunity. If a region is doing poorly, a data-driven forecast will identify it early enough to fix it. The forecast should give you information about product lines, business segments and strength or weakness by industry. It should be broken down by business type – new name account, upsell, renewal. It should give you competitive data and insight into the effective of your sales process. In the past, we waited for the quarter to be over before analyzing this data and then reacted. You can’t do that today. You must be gathering, analyzing and actioning data in real time.\n\nWe all know the world has changed. Every aspect of business is using data to make predictions and better decisions. Sales leaders must not be left behind.\n\nReady to see your business in an AI-driven sales forecasting and insights platform? <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/contact-us/\">Schedule a meeting!</a>\n\n&nbsp;",

		"title": "Use Data Science to Increase Rep Productivity",
		"image": "",
		"content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For years, reps have predicted their quarters based on scant historical knowledge, shakey trend lines, and a mix of pure optimism, healthy skepticism, and good old fashioned best guessing. What else did we all have to go on? As sales execs, we lay our careers on making that number as accurate as possible--as positive as we feel is reasonable and as risk-averse as we feel safe saying out loud.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then data science came along and changed the game--for you and your competitors. At Aviso, we like to call it the data-driven fairy godmother to help manage your quarter. Data science gives sales teams the ability to gain insights into their pipeline that aren’t readily seen by the naked human eye. Accurate forecasts, and important insights at the deal level, help reps to prioritize their time and tackle the right opportunities to make sure they have their best quarter ever. Because, at the end of the day, it’ sall about managing our business and prioritizing our time--the most precious resource of all. </span>\n<h2><b>Three ways data science makes your job easier</b></h2>\n<b>Data Level Forecasting to Know the Real Deal--on Each Deal</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this level, sales teams gain insights into individual opportunities to understand whether they are on track to make their quarterly number, based on historical trends of similar opportunities. The Aviso Score gives you the exact likelihood of an opportunity closing within a current quarter, whether it’s going to get pushed out, or whether it’s a lost cause. For example,  if an opportunity has a low Aviso Score, but it is in a late stage or has a close date around the corner, this requires some investigation to find out what’s going on. And, just for fun, compare your Aviso Score with your internal metrics and see how they stack up at the end of the quarter. We think you’ll be impressed at how close the Aviso Score came to the actual revenue number. We have a 95% accuracy rate, based on data from </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aviso customers, which is growing even higher</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\n\n<b>Aggregate Forecasting to Hit Your Number </b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This number is the big prediction for your quarter as a whole. It takes into account the forecasted amount of opportunities won--that aren’t even in your pipeline at the beginning of the quarter. The Aviso Forecast predicts what will come in and what will close, within a particular timeline, and provides an end of quarter forecast on day one with a week-by-week trajectory on the materialization of that deal. We know it can seem a little like sales forecasting hocus pocus, but it’s the real deal. The average Aviso customer realizes a number within 5% of the “day one of the quarter” forecast. </span>\n\n<b>Trending Data to Detect Early Warning Signs</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We love looking at trend lines and trajectories, particularly if they are going up and to the right. But, what if they aren’t? Wouldn’t you want to know earlier vs. later? The Aviso Trend Module allows you to track the Aviso Forecast and Expected Realization against your “won to date” values and internal forecasts. It raises the flag when things are going the wrong way and suggests course corrections to get things back on track. </span>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/contact-us/\"><b>Contact us to learn more!</b></a>",

		"content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most sales organizations have a unique set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that they track religiously. Other than basic revenue numbers which have been tracked since the early days of trade and commerce (ok, basically since the beginning of human civilization), it was business intelligence (BI) that really gave life to a more complex set of data analysis capable of being stored, tracked, sorted, searched, and modeled. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data science takes “basic intelligence” to the next level. Using data science, massive amounts of information can be processed instantly to provide insights that are simply impossible using rudimentary equations. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We believe data science can help sales teams create and maintain the most accurate and up-to-date sales forecasts possible. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aviso’s data science technology can do three things better than old-school BI technologies:</span>\n<ol>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Forecasting: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BI can try to predict your forecast, but only with data science can you produce accurate predictive answers. Aviso uses Data Science to arrive at a data-driven end of quarter number that averages within 4% of your company’s actual EOQ bookings. Even better, Aviso breaks this EOQ prediction down week by week - giving you early warning signs if your quarter is off track, and the necessary time to adjust your sales strategy to ensure a successful quarter.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Focusing: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BI is excellent at averaging bulk numbers and giving a general percentage of what will close in a quarter, but not good at pinpointing which individual deals will actually come in and which ones will fall out--introducing an intolerable amount of risk. Aviso scores each deal--between 0 and 100--and gives you the exact likelihood of a specific opportunity closing within the current quarter and looks at how the deal should be progressing compared to similar and historical opportunities. Handy, right?</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Prioritizing: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is an area where BI definitely falls short. For BI technologies, figuring out which deals that reps and managers should focus on is a complete guessing game. Aviso’s special sauce lets you know exactly which deals to focus on and suggests activities, strategies, and communications that will help bring the most critical deals across the finish line.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We talk a big game, but don’t take our word for it.

		"title": "Why I Started Aviso",
		"image": "",
		"content": "After two years of hard work developing a product with a set of phenomenal early customers, I am excited about coming out of stealth mode and publicly launching our company.\n\nI would like to kick-off my blog by answering some questions that folks have been asking me: Why Aviso? Why now? Why us?\n\n<strong>First, why Aviso?</strong> Aviso was borne out of necessity! A strong need for better tools for my colleagues and I to make critical decisions around growing revenue for our businesses:\n<ul>\n \t<li>It was borne out of the anxiety of trying to extract signal from so much noise in the information systems I had access to, and preparing for Monday morning sales meetings on Sunday night, weekly executive staff meetings and quarterly board meetings;</li>\n \t<li>It was borne out of the desperation of staring at spreadsheets hoping they would produce some insights/signal to aid my decision making; and,</li>\n \t<li>And finally, Aviso was also borne out of the recognition that I needed better software solutions to avoid some of the pitfalls of making decisions swayed by emotions.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Second, Why now? </strong>The good news is that the in spite of the limitations of current enterprise software products like CRM and ERP systems, they have one redeeming feature, they all store tons and tons of information, including maintaining a record of the past. Access to these reservoirs of data allows us to learn from the past to make better decisions about the future.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">George Santayana, <em>The Life of Reason</em></p>\nThe proper techniques to extract value from this data (often very noisy) requires advanced mathematical frameworks, and enormous computational power to perform billions of calculations computing all possible trajectories/scenarios. Previously, these computations would have cost millions of dollars. Today those same computations can be performed for a few dollars because of advances in cloud computing technologies.\n\n<strong>Third, Why us? </strong>Because my co-founder, Andrew Abrahams – who retired as the head of quantitative research for JP Morgan Chase after 15 years -- and I like to work on hard problems for which solutions can have high impact; and because we believe that proper use of mathematical frameworks can drive better behavior, better decisions, and help every enterprise make smarter bets to grow their revenues. With our two decades of experience in high performance computing, simulations, analysis, and quantitative finance, and the two years we invested in developing our Total Revenue Intelligence solution, we believe that we are well positioned to help every enterprise improve how they make decisions that impact revenue and performance. By combining machine learning techniques with portfolio management frameworks into a cloud application, our vision for the future is that every enterprise will use Aviso for their critical revenue decisions: from setting expectations with their Board and Wall Street to optimizing how their business allocates resources, makes pricing decisions, and drives sales performance.\n\nWe are off to a good start with an incredibly talented and hard working team, some great early adopter customers (FireEye, RingCentral, Saba Software, Damballa, Replicon and Zuora), and incredible investors, VCs: Shasta, Cowboy, Bloomberg Beta, First Round Capital, and CEOs/CFOs of leading public and private companies: WebEx, Jive, Informix, Vantive, Netsuite. This is just the beginning, and we have big aspirations to drive alignment, confidence and improvement around all aspects of revenue in the enterprise.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>A few smart decisions and a lot of constructive collaboration will improve confidence - and confidence is the “secret sauce” of growth.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Jamie Dimon, CEO JPMorgan Chase in<em> 2013 Annual Report Letter to Shareholders</em></p>\nNow that we are out of stealth mode, you will read, see, and hear from us a lot in this blog, and in other forums and we welcome your feedback, comments, and suggestions.",
