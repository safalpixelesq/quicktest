					"description": "Covid-19 forced pharmaceutical companies globally to critically evaluate their customer engagement and sales practices. Pharmaceutical companies, on an average, reduced the size of their sales workforce 4%-6% during the pandemic. Research indicates that going forward less than 25% of interactions between a healthcare professional (HCP), medical sales liaison (MSL), and sales rep could be ‘in-person’. Over 60% of interactions will be ‘hybrid’, both in-person and virtual. Lockdowns, social distancing, and travel restrictions have permanently altered how both HCP’s and pharmaceutical reps engage with each other. </br> </br>Omni-channel communication and AI-driven engagement is emerging as a top trend in Life Sciences and Pharma, with increasing pressure on delivering a digital new normal for all participants. HCPs are under more stress and need to balance time between patient care and virtual sales interactions.  The industry’s future depends on balancing regulatory compliance, improving rep productivity, and engaging differently across a new generation of digital-first Field Reps, HCPs, and MSLs.",
