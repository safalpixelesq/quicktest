With the emergence of virtual offices, the standardization of 5G, the rise of Product Led Growth (PLG), hyperautomation, and the shift from products to new generation digital services the supply chain of the High-Tech industry faced more opportunity and risk than ever before.</br> </br>Omni-channel customer experiences that integrate paradigms such as Voice and the Metaverse are now part of High-Tech selling more than before. New digital workspaces can help High-Tech reps cover more accounts than before, differentiate via novel digital experiences, and align GTM teams for a world of 100% deal acquisition and expansion model. The industry’s future depends on preparing sellers for a new generation of digital-first buying groups who do comparison shopping, bargain for value, and want to try before they buy. ",
