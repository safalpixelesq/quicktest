The technology will not only deliver a personalized experience to your customers but also enhance overall customer satisfaction. Conversational artificial intelligence is growing more prevalent each day. Whether you’re speaking to a voice assistant or interacting with a chatbot, technology is working behind the scenes to analyze what is being said (usually called “intent”), and build a suitable response.\n\n<strong>Here’s what we’ll cover in this article:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>What Is Conversational AI?</li>\n \t<li>Why Is Conversational AI Important?</li>\n \t<li>Types Of Conversational Intelligence</li>\n \t<li>How Does Conversational AI Work?</li>\n \t<li>Components Of Conversational Intelligence</li>\n \t<li>How To Implement Conversational Intelligence?</li>\n \t<li>How To Automate Conversational AI?</li>\n \t<li>Conversational AI Examples And Use Cases</li>\n \t<li>Aviso AI's Advanced Conversational Intelligence</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>What Is Conversational AI?</strong></h2>\nConversational artificial intelligence (AI) is a set of technologies that work behind voice-enabled and automated messaging applications to provide human-like interactions between humans and computers. It allows computers to understand, analyze, and respond to human text and speech inputs. Conversational artificial intelligence can understand human intent, decode different languages, and respond in a way that's similar to humans.\n\nThere's a lot of <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/conversational-intelligence/\">conversational intelligence</a></span> involved that works behind the technology. That's because human language consists of complex scenarios due to the involvement of multiple meanings of the same word, slang, clarifications, interruptions, etc. Human text, tone, voice, and gestures also need to be analyzed. Due to this, conversational intelligence provides capabilities that go beyond predefined paths.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/go-to-market-gtm-strategy/\">How To Build A Go To Market Strategy</a></span></strong></p>\n\n<h3><strong>Difference Between Conversational AI And Chatbots</strong></h3>\nThrough conversational AI and chatbots are often used interchangeably, they are not exactly the same. Here are the main differences between the two:\n<ul>\n \t<li>While conversational AI can process text and voice commands; chatbots can manage only text commands.</li>\n \t<li>Conversational intelligence can be deployed on voice assistants, websites, and smart speakers; chatbots can only be used as a chat interface.</li>\n \t<li>Conversational artificial intelligence considers natural language processing (NLP); chatbots work on pre-defined scripted conversation text flow.</li>\n \t<li>Conversational AI is focused on dialogue; chatbots are focused on navigation.</li>\n \t<li>Conversational intelligence can manage wide-scope and dynamic interactions; chatbots find it hard to manage out-of-scope tasks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Why Is Conversational AI Important?</strong></h2>\nOrganizations use conversational artificial intelligence in their sales, marketing, and customer support processes to offer a highly engaging customer journey. For instance, conversational AI for customer service helps organizations manage a lot of repetitive support tasks.\n\nAs conversational AI doesn’t depend on predefined scripts, it allows businesses to automate customized support for each customer. It helps make each interaction unique, reduces the resolution time, and enhances customer satisfaction.\n\nAlso, Conversational intelligence can be deployed in different customer service channels such as chat, voice, email, messaging, and social media. It allows organizations to scale their customer support to new channels to satisfy customer needs.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/sales-forecasting/\">How To Forecast Sales</a></span></strong></p>\n\n<h2><strong>4 Types Of Conversational Intelligence</strong></h2>\nHere are the different types of conversational AI that you can deploy in your organization:\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h4><strong>Chatbots:</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\nThese were introduced to automate customer support. You can find chatbots in various places such as websites, display advertising, and Facebook Messenger. They mostly respond to a customer's basic support queries and help them find products they want to buy.\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h4><strong>Voice Assistants:</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong><span style=\"font-weight: 500;\">These are similar to chatbots, but you need to speak out loud to interact with them. These mostly help you make phone calls, answer queries, set reminders, and alarms, play music, or provide weather updates. Examples are Amazon Alexa and Google Home.</span></strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h4><strong>Mobile Assistants:</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong><span style=\"font-weight: 500;\">These include Siri, Google Now, and others, and work similar to voice assistants. They help you perform tasks that need to be done quickly while you are doing something else such as driving or walking.</span></strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h4><strong>Interactive Voice Recognition Systems (IVRS):</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong><span style=\"font-weight: 500;\">These are used to automate customer service support and are used in contact centers. They help reduce service costs and enhance customer satisfaction.</span></strong>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/sales-pipeline-management/\">Importance of Sales Pipeline Management</a></span></strong></p>\n\n<h2><strong>How Does Conversational AI Work?</strong></h2>\nConversational AI works by combining machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and automated speech recognition (ASR) to analyze and contextualize the spoken and written words. It identifies and comes up with the best possible way to manage and respond to human input.\n\nConversational AI breaks down sentences to their root level. It pulls out human intent by determining patterns that it has been trained to find. It considers factors such as grammar, slang, synonyms, and more. Here, intent refers to what the human is trying to achieve.\n<h2><strong>Components Of Conversational Intelligence</strong></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversational AI includes four main components: input processing, input analysis, output generation, and reinforcement learning. These four components are explained below.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h4><b>Input Processing:</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A human provides text or voice input through an application or website. For spoken words, speech recognition converts voice into text for the computer to read.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h4><b>Input Analysis:</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The conversation engine uses NLP to decode the meaning and determine the intent of the text.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h4><b>Output Generation:</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The application builds a response based on the intent using Dialog Management. Then, NLP analyzes and converts the response into a format that's understood by humans.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h4><b>Reinforcement Learning:</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ML algorithms learn from the whole process and refine the response going forward to provide a better response in the future.</span>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a style=\"color: #3366ff;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/revenue-forecasting/\">Best Revenue Forecasting Models</a></span></strong></p>\n\n<h2><strong>How To Implement Conversational Intelligence?</strong></h2>\nTo implement conversational artificial intelligence services in your business, the best way to start is by integrating your existing systems (such as CRM or sales technologies) with NLP and ML.
