This question has worked its way into every aspect of our lives, from everyday routines to inspiring value propositions. With so many aspects of the business world increasingly becoming tech-reliant, how does this affect revenue acceleration efforts? To understand the future of a key aspect of all industries and business ventures, let's first get into the basics.\n<h2><strong>What Is Revenue Acceleration?</strong></h2>\nRevenue acceleration is the process of coexistence between marketing, sales, and customer service in order to achieve a shared goal of driving revenue. Alignment through consistent communication, optimized tools, and a concise vision is essential to a successful revenue acceleration implementation. The next generation of revenue acceleration operations can be broken down into three main components.\n<h2><strong>Components Of Next-Gen Revenue Acceleration Operations</strong></h2>\nRegardless of the strategy for a revenue acceleration plan, you must have the following three components for a successful implementation:\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11190 size-full\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.5x-Gartner-Hype-Cycle-Infographic.png\" alt=\"Components of next gen. revenue operations: data, insights and actions\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" />\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Data:</strong></li>\n</ul>\nTo build a source of truth you can confidently base your business decisions on, and to free your teams from the shackles of manual input. Look at all the disparate data sets that are generated in a sales cycle and combine them into an opportunity-focused, deal-velocity-oriented view.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Insights:</strong></li>\n</ul>\nWith AI and a deep understanding of what drives revenue and people is ideal. Adopt a platform that allows sync with your CRM, email, and calendar to generate key insights to help your sales teams progress towards revenue acceleration goals.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Actions:</strong></li>\n</ul>\nEmpowering you and your teams to make the right decisions at the right time. Practicing Nudge Theory, find <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/ai-sales-forecasting/\">guided-selling intelligence</a> that proactively recommends actions that your sales reps should take.\n<h2><strong>Stages of Revenue Acceleration</strong></h2>\nIncorporating the components above, use the stages below to create a timeline for your revenue acceleration efforts.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Personalized Engagement:</strong></li>\n</ul>\nLive chatbots offer a constant stream of communication to the customer. Outdated CRMs limit the Marketing, customer service, and SDR teams to data silos. When data is presented in a clear, concise, and easy-to-digest format, making personalized connections with customers is that much easier. An adept way to do this is by adopting a system with nudges and insights that break down the data into bite-size pieces.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Expedite Deal Sequence:</strong></li>\n</ul>\nDeal insights and nudges can allow for the closure of deals sooner than anticipated. By assessing past and current data streams, AI engines are able to predict future wins and pick up on deals you might not have been considering for your current and next quarter pipeline. Having a platform that alerts you to these insights with a <a href=\"https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/nudge/\">nudge theory</a> based system can accelerate deal cycles.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Integrate On All Levels:</strong></li>\n</ul>\nAt the endpoint of any revenue acceleration revamp, the end goal should be full integration of those components previously mentioned. With optimized data retention and doing away with data silos, outdated CRM, spreadsheets, and other limited containment systems, you should already begin to see revenue acceleration occurring. Pairing with insights from <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/conversational-intelligence/\">conversational intelligence</a>, artificial intelligence and a platform that incorporates the methodology of Nudge Theory on all revenue acceleration teams (SDR, CS, marketing, etc.) will bring about the best results.\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/revenue-forecasting/\">Best Revenue Forecasting Models</a></strong></p>\n\n<h2><strong>AI For Revenue Acceleration</strong></h2>\nIn Gartner’s Hype Cycle for CRM Sales Technologies, Aviso was mentioned as a sample vendor in the <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/sales-forecasting/\">predictive sales forecasting</a> tech space. In this space, vendors apply machine learning algorithms to a client’s historical opportunity and account data to provide statistically derived insights to sales reps in three categories: predictive forecasting, <a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/pipeline-acceleration/\">pipeline inspection</a>, as well as opportunity, lead, and account health scoring.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-11189 size-full\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.5x-Gartner-Hype-Cycle-Hype-Cycle.png\" alt=\"Hope cycle for CRM tech \" width=\"1800\" height=\"901\" />\n\nThe business impact of the technology is huge, as clients experience better deal closure rates and forecast accuracy.
