Rao who also founded Zuora with Cheng Zou and Tien Tzuo in 2007.\n\nFounding a company with just an idea and a vision - powering the subscription economy- is an incredibly daunting and difficult task. Seeing Tien ring the opening bell at the NYSE with K.V. and Shasta partner Jason Pressman as well as Zuora’s President of Field Ops, Marc Diouane, is a motivational force for all of us here at Aviso. We know they have built a world class company that’s not only helping its customers, but fulfilling an important transformational role in our economy. People do not want to buy goods and services by paying for them upfront. We’d rather pay for them as we use them over time in a subscription model. Zuora has successfully enabled this shift for newer companies like Box, Zendesk and Docusign as well as traditional companies like CAT, Ford and GE as they make this monumental transition.\n\nWe are proud to have played a very small part in Zuora’s success story by enabling their sales leadership with AI-driven forecasting models and we look forward to seeing Zuora soar into the future.","items":[{"subtitle":"ABOUT AUTHOR","title":"Amit Pande","description":"EVP of Strategy and all things growth at Aviso.
