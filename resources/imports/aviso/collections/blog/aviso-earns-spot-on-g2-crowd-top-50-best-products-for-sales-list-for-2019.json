Aviso was fortunate enough to land on this year’s <a href=\"https://www.g2crowd.com/best-software-companies/top-sales\">Top 50 Best Products for Sales</a> list for 2019, coming in at #47. We were proud to be selected from amongst thousands of vendors in the Sales Tech Landscape.\n\nThe equivalent of The People’s Choice Awards for tech companies, G2 Crowd’s Best Software Awards provide the definitive ranking of the best software companies and products worldwide.\n\nCompanies that end up on this coveted list are selected based on data provided by<strong> its users</strong>, and, as a result, have proven their commitment to customers. With over 45,000 software companies on G2, Aviso’s recognition on the prestigious Top 50 Best Products for Sales list is an exceptional achievement, and one that can only be earned through the endorsement of our users.\n\nG2 Crowd compiled the list using data collected from over 270,000 authentic customer reviews written between Jan. 1 and Dec. 31, 2018. Reviews spanned across nearly 60,000 software products, with every single review vetted by an individual person, not a machine, to ensure legitimacy.\n\nThis is our first time earning the title as one of G2’s Best Software winners.\n\n“This is no subjective list by a few people giving their opinions,” CEO Godard Abel explains. “With the highest traffic and engagement, largest selection of products and services, and highest quality data, G2 Crowd is able to harness more than 4 million data points to determine which products and companies are doing the best job of helping businesses reach their potential.”\n\nWe want to extend a special thanks to our loyal customers who not only help us prove the value of AI for sales every day but also go the extra mile to let us know how we’re doing and help us continually improve our solution through valuable tools like G2 Crowd. We look forward to continuing to provide value to your businesses and sales processes in 2019.",
