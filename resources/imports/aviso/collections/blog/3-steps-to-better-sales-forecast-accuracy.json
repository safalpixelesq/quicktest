Yet, many sales teams and leaders still struggle to obtain sales forecasts that accurately reflect reality. This is an issue because sales forecast accuracy is essential to driving revenue.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accurate sales forecasts can offer many benefits, including:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Driving smarter decision-making. </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Propelling growth. </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conveying confidence to the Board that your business is supported by a reliable forecasting machine that will </span><em><a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/the-top-3-ways-ai-guided-forecasting-beats-spreadsheets/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scale well in the future.</span></a></em></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allowing opportunity management and pipeline risk assessment. </span></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<blockquote><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accurate sales forecasts are linked to a </span><em><a href=\"https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/76666/file-2123964942-pdf/SalesForecasting_infographic_v6.pdf?t=1418163069861&amp;__hstc=20629287.80be225a07fa7ecd1732904b76cad229.1495970233568.1495970233568.1504089080604.2&amp;__hssc=20629287.1.1504089080604&amp;__hsfp=1655232329\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">25% increase in YOY revenue performance</span></a></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>.</em> </span></blockquote>\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet despite these critical factors accurate sales forecasts hold in revenue growth, according to Xant, more than 70% of sales forecasts are inaccurate. This means that the odds are that </span><em><a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/this-is-why-your-sales-forecasts-are-inaccurate/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you’re doing something wrong</span></a></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or could be doing more. Moreover, reps spent around 2.5 hours per week forecasting, while managers spent 1.5 hours. Think of all the wasted time and misguided decisions that could be avoided. Fret not, a quick read of this article can set you on the right path. </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three ways to boost your sales forecast accuracy</span></h2>\n&nbsp;\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.Identify sources of forecast inaccuracy.</span></h2>\n&nbsp;\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Common sources of inaccuracy include:</span></h3>\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-11173 aligncenter\" src=\"https://assets.uiaas.io/web/aviso/blog/sources-of-forecast-inaccuracy-571x300.webp\" alt=\"pie chart of sources of sales forecast inaccuracy\" width=\"571\" height=\"300\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subjectivity</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reliance on gut feelings from reps and managers can easily skew predictions from reality. Being influenced by personal feelings or opinions rather than accurately interpreting the data, is a drawback that comes from human nature and error. There are areas when subjectivity and intuition can be helpful to a sales rep but interpreting data points isn’t one of them.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time Spent</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned previously, on average <em>r</em></span><em><a href=\"https://www.xant.ai/5-sales-forecasting-strategies/#forecasting\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eps spend 2.5 hours per week and managers 1.5 hours on forecasts. </span></a></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is time spent on tedious data entry leading to inaccurate forecasts, resulting in what seems to be meaningless busywork. Allocating resources and time to the right activities is important to an efficient and effective organizational management design. It should go without saying that your team members could be more productive if their time was freed from crunching numbers on outdated systems and spreadsheets. </span>\n\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-11174 aligncenter\" src=\"https://assets.uiaas.io/web/aviso/blog/time-spent-2-571x300.webp\" alt=\"time spent on forecasting stat\" width=\"571\" height=\"300\" />\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volatility</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sales landscape is constantly changing, just think of the past year and the unprecedented impacts that Covid-19 had on the market. It’s difficult to </span><em><a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/path-to-plan-covid-19/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">accurately predict</span></a></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> how these factors will affect your revenue stream. Software that incorporates machine learning and can analyze abundant points of data new and old quickly, is the best way to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">incorporate rapidly changing new changes into our predictive models.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Methodologies</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Historical data is not always accurate (see above). Time-series forecasting, for example, that predicts future values based on past data, can only serve as a benchmark but does not take into account other factors. </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clunky Tools</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long story short, spreadsheets are not conducive to forecasting. Classic models of CRMs by themselves, are not cutting it anymore. As we evolve in our workspaces and with technology, our sales forecasting tools need to be able to keep up. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By first identifying these sources of sales forecast inaccuracy, you can then focus on addressing the ones that need immediate attention. </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Clean up your data.</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s be real: manual data entry sucks. Very few (if any) salespeople say that CRM data entry is their favorite part of the job. Here is where sources of sales forecast inaccuracy can easily slip in. This is a critical flaw because the first and foremost requirement for an accurate sales forecast is clean data. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For clean data you must: </span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create and enforce a standardized checklist of guidelines for data entry.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incentivize the results.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The smarter option to reduce the issue: </span><b>adopt automation</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-11175 aligncenter\" src=\"https://assets.uiaas.io/web/aviso/blog/automation-571x300.webp\" alt=\"automation=time saved\" width=\"571\" height=\"300\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Modern sales tools come with automated data entry systems for a smoother, less taxing experience. Automatic data cleaning technology is available on the market today, typically powered by auto-machine learning algorithms that identify information that needs to be inputted in various go-to-market systems. Additional automation tool options include automated nudge systems, which can provide timely reminders and alerts to </span><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/new-product-update-nudges/\">“nudge”</a></em></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> users to take action toward deal progression.  Nudge Theory suggests that appropriately placed nudges can </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stimulate advantageous actions and help increase the efficiency of resource use.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Integrate your revenue teams.</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salespeople want to be selling. As such, keep time spent on forecasting to a minimum -- but make it as effective as possible.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to get effective and efficient forecasting: </span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Deploy a tool that unifies all teams</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Ops, Finance, Product) on one platform, rather than juggling multiple software. With a single tool, you can better hone in on your sales forecast accuracy as well as cut down on data slippage, collaboration inefficiencies, and wasted budget. Your salespeople will appreciate this as well. </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Consider getting an advanced sales analytics tool</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that can be customized for each position in the sales hierarchy, from reps to managers to CROs, in addition to offering an advanced deal and pipeline insight and coaching features for seamless collaboration.</span></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After auditing your current forecasting system, you should be able to find which step would be best to first go forward with. With successful incorporation of the steps of increasing sales forecasting accuracy, you should be able to see the effectiveness directly on your revenue performance. Happy forecasting!</span>",
