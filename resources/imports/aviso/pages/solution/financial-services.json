					"description": "Even before Covid-19 financial services leaders were dealing with seismic shifts including the greatest intergenerational transfer of wealth exceeding $2 Trillion, increased cybersecurity risks, and the rise of robo-advisors. In 2018, Fidelity research showed that 40% of advisors had no increase in their book of business. The pandemic accelerated digitalization and led financial advisors to further evaluate their customer engagement and sales practices and embrace AI, RPA, and new kinds of SaaS for customer engagement, anti-fraud, regulatory compliance and process optimization. <br/> <br />Personalized, omni-channel customer experiences are now the new frontier in Financial Services. They can help advisors cover more accounts than before, differentiate via novel digital experiences, and align Advisory teams for a world of 100% virtual relationship management. The industry’s future depends on tapping the wallets of a new generation of digital-first clients and family offices, while staying compliant with regulatory authorities. ",
