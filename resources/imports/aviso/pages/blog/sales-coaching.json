Nonetheless, sales coaching remains a critical component in the role of a sales manager: with effective coaching, managers have the opportunity to empower reps, guide personal development, and drive better results. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again and again, sales coaching has proven ROI.

What approach should you take? How do you know whether your coaching is actually working?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As effective sales leaders know, <strong>sales coaching is</strong> <strong>both an art and a science.</strong></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Modern sales coaches with high-performing teams are empathetic and motivational. At the same time, sales coaches must be experienced, data-driven, and knowledgeable in how to tailor their coaching for each seller depending on the seller’s level of expertise. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ready to get started on becoming a great sales coach? Here are 5 research-backed strategies used by high-performing managers to guide their teams to sales success.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Implement an Incentive System</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to motivating behaviors, </span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><a style=\"color: #800000;\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/09/what-motivates-employees-more-rewards-or-punishments\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">instantaneous positive feedback is much more likely to be effective</span></a></span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than punishments or threats. </span>\n\n<img class=\"alignright wp-image-11115\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/award-682x600.png\" alt=\"Employee of the month sample template. Jennifer Wang.\" width=\"249\" height=\"219\" />\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get creative with </span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #800000; text-decoration: underline;\"><a style=\"color: #800000; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"https://www.challengeconsulting.com.au/announcements/what-are-incentives-at-work/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">activities and incentives</span></a></span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to build positivity and motivate your team. Send personal notes, </span>present an award, or make an announcement acknowledging team members for their contributions and effort, both as individuals and as a collective.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a more general level, it’s important to establish and communicate a commission structure in your sales organization that is clear, transparent, and up-to-date.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One option you might consider is a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://blog.wagepoint.com/all-content/how-commission-works-and-how-to-choose-the-right-payroll-structure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span style=\"color: #800000; text-decoration: underline;\">tiered commission hierarchy</span></a></span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which provides a sense of competition and accomplishment as reps move up tiers. Under this structure, commission rate increases as a rep reaches a certain minimum of a sales metric, such as deals closed or revenue brought in. </span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Coach Rep Performance with Data</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you find that a rep is performing poorly compared to the rest of your team, your first response might be to shadow them to try and figure out what’s going wrong.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although shadowing can be helpful, it can only show part of the equation. Supplement your shadow session with a deep dive into the data you have available from your CRM or sales analytics software.</span>\n\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-11117\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Collaboration-Sales-Owner-Scorecard-722x600.png\" alt=\"Sales rep card.

Derive tactics for success and turn them into coachable moments to be shared with your entire team when you spot an opportunity. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a different note… </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wouldn’t it be great if you </span><span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #993366;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/deal-intelligence/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">could automatically analyze rep activities and generate data-based suggestions for improvement?</span> </span></a></span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Ask the Right Questions</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When looking for patterns of seller success or potential improvement in your data, come prepared with focus questions in mind -- most importantly, how you can coach your rep to develop new and existing skills to improve their performance.</span>\n\n<img class=\"alignright wp-image-11116\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/chart.png\" alt=\"Sales manager and rep looking through historical data. Courtesy of graphic design team.\" width=\"231\" height=\"251\" />\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re looking through call transcriptions, you might ask: do they need coaching on how to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bui</span>ld trust with prospects? If your rep keeps on forgetting to qualify buyers, do they need to set up <span style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #993366;\"><a style=\"color: #993366; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/new-product-update-nudges/\">a nudge system</a></span> to keep them on track? If your rep is ignoring forecasts and going ahead with risky deals, what can you do to <span style=\"color: #800000;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a style=\"color: #800000; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"https://www.aviso.com/blog/5-surprising-reasons-why-your-deals-arent-closing-and-what-to-do-instead/\">divert this energy</a></span>?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use this data to prepare for sales coaching meetings so that you aren’t wasting time asking questions that might lead to defensive answers or confusion on the part of your rep.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more you know beforehand, the better you can tailor the discussion, and the more productive your conversations will be.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Leverage Outside Resources </span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the world of sales is vast, it can be easy to get stuck in a sales-centered bubble. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a sales manager, you likely have access to a wealth of valuable resources, including connections to the marketing or customer relations departments. Leverage these connections to gain information and knowledge your reps will need to succeed. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some examples of resources you might reach out for:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Customer FAQs, to be included in a demo</strong></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Top customer or user complaints, to prep for objections</strong></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>A curated selection of customer stories, to send in follow-up emails</strong></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Listen to Your Team</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, sales coaching involves taking a step back. Encourage your reps to tell you what exactly they’re struggling with. This might be something that can’t be gleaned from the data, or may be a side effect of a larger issue.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, allowing your reps to disclose their concerns can help you better assess your reps’ strengths and weaknesses and better understand how to coach them. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, taking a step back can mean trusting your team to teach themselves. Schedule a meeting to ask them to share with one another what’s working and what’s not. Evidence shows that </span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #800000; text-decoration: underline;\"><a style=\"color: #800000; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"https://medium.com/bestcompany/experts-vs-friends-the-definitive-guide-to-who-influences-us-and-why-6a0aa609c8c0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we place a lot of value in the words of our peers</span></a></span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #800000; text-decoration: underline;\">,</span></span> and it might turn out that one of your reps learns better by listening to other reps in the field.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ask your top performers to speak about their successes and failures, and listen in on their stories. Encourage your low performers to speak as well -- they might have some surprising insights! </span>\n\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-11118\" src=\"https://www.aviso.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/conv.png\" alt=\"Conversational intelligence, call transcriptions and recordings, and other data to use in your sales coaching analysis.
