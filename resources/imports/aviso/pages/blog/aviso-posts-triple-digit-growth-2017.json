I want to thank all of our customers, our partners and our employees for their trust, dedication and hard work.\n\nAviso exists solely to help our customers grow their businesses faster through the use of Artificial Intelligence in Sales. Applying AI to Sales is an idea that our Founders envisioned 4 years ago and after living on the bleeding edge for a while, the idea is now becoming mainstream.\n\nWe at Aviso are proud of our accomplishments in several key areas.\n<h3><strong>We Grew Customer Growth and Adoption.</strong></h3>\nAviso achieved triple digit growth as our existing customers expanded and deepened their use of AI in their organizations. Companies like RingCentral, Splunk and Apttus embraced the use of AI at an even deeper level than ever and have made Aviso an important part of their sales process.\n\nWe added some exciting new customers to the Aviso platform in 2017.  They range from one of the largest multinational technology companies in the world to newly public companies like MongoDB to fast growing private companies like Elastic and Mesosphere.\n\nOur customers not only use AI for Sales forecasting, Aviso’s traditional strength, but also to drive big improvements in their pipeline management and deal review processes.\n<h3><strong>We Expanded our Product Line.</strong></h3>\nOur product and engineering teams had a milestone year. We overhauled our flagship forecasting product with an brand new UI and an enhanced mobile app, AvisoGo.  We deepened our forecasting capabilities and introduced three completely new modules: Pipeline management, Deal Review and Sales Visibility.  We also infused each of these modules with unique capabilities that leverage the largest and most comprehensive time series database in the industry.\n<h3><strong>We Extended our AI Leadership.</strong></h3>\nIt’s become very popular for legacy technology vendors to rebrand their products with the AI label by slapping a logo on their homepage. Aviso was born as an AI company and 40% of our engineering team is dedicated solely to data science. That team had a tremendous year. They were not content to sit on the laurels of our industry leading forecasting algorithms.\n\nThey deepened and expanded these algorithms while shipping breakthrough AI features that include: a Predictive Pipeline Valuator, a Pipeline Change Analytics feature set, an AI-based Sales Pacing Model, enhanced AI-based Deal Insights and richer Deal Score Explanations within our industry leading deal scoring technology. Each of these features bring unparalleled new insights to sales management and sales leaders.\n\nFinally, our AI-based algorithms have consumed over 5 million live sales opportunities and that volume continues to improve accuracy on a daily basis. Furthermore, in 2017 our algorithms generated 1.3 million hours of CPU usage to produce our customers predictions.\n<h3><strong>We Expanded our Partner Network.</strong></h3>\nWe have always had a great partnership with Salesforce. You can find our products in the AppExchange and we are members of their ISV program. We work closely with their product teams to ensure maximum levels of integration, and you will also find us on the Dreamforce floor as well as blazing a trail as a sponsor of Salesforce World Tour events.\n\nWe also began working more closely last year with Microsoft and Oracle, and are committed to partnering with them to bring the benefits of AI to their respective customer bases.\n\nWe also announced a robust Global Partner Program and a new set of open APIs that will allow other sales tech vendors to easily integrate with Aviso.\n<h3><strong>We Grew our Team.</strong></h3>\nIn addition to growing in the above areas, Aviso also grew as a company. We added new executive talent in Sales, Business Development, Product Management, Engineering and Marketing, from industry leaders like Zuora, Jive, Oracle, Salesforce, Deloitte and SugarCRM.  Our USA headcount grew by over 20% and we also made large and continued investments in our Aviso India corporation in Hyderabad.\n\n2017 was a milestone year for Aviso with a ton of progress but I feel our work has just begun. AI is transforming our lives as consumers and the B2B application of AI is now becoming mainstream. We won’t rest until all sales reps, first line sales managers, sales operations and sales leaders are armed with the most advanced AI-driven forecasting solution on the market.\n\nStay tuned. There’s a lot more to come in 2018 and we are excited to continue on this highly rewarding journey with you all!","items":[{"subtitle":"ABOUT AUTHOR","title":"Amit Pande","description":"EVP of Strategy and all things growth at Aviso.
