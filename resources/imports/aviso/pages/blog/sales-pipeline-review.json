Because this process was so central to the sales team, we wanted to know how happy salespeople were with their current review process.\n\nWhat we found out is the majority of sales teams have been using the same tools for 20+ years. These teams also admit that, with their current method, deals often slipped through the cracks.\n<h2><strong>What's wrong with CRM reports and spreadsheets?</strong></h2>\nIf you’re like most sales teams in B2B tech organizations, you export CRM data into a spreadsheet in preparation for a meeting on your sales pipeline review. First, you sort deals by forecast category and then sub-sort them by deal size. Then, reps and managers sit down together, start at the top of the list and work their way to the bottom, reviewing each deal.\n\nPlodding your way down a spreadsheet is problematic for two main reasons:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Deals with large amounts and deals that fall into the best case and commit category are generally reviewed during typical deal review meetings. </strong>The top-down method employed by most teams focuses primarily on deals at the end of the sales process. Not enough time is spent reviewing the status of mid-funnel deals or talking through new pipeline generation.</li>\n \t<li><strong>You can’t see what changed since last week.</strong> This lack of visibility makes it difficult to assess progress.</li>\n</ol>\nThere is a better way, and it involves generating revenue through the use of AI.\n\nRight about now, most of you are thinking:\n<h2><strong>Do I really need to apply AI to my sales pipeline reviews? </strong></h2>\n<strong>The answer is YES. Here's why.</strong>\n\nHigh-performing sales teams — those driving significant revenue growth — are applying AI to sales processes mostly closely connected to revenue generation, including pipeline reviews, forecasting, and deal reviews.\n\nAccording to Salesforce’s Special Report titled “The AI Revolution,” there’s a clear relationship between early adoption of AI and future success. Sales teams who have significantly increased their YoY revenue growth are <strong>3.1x more likely</strong> than their underperforming counterparts — those with negative YoY revenue growth — to use AI currently, or plan to do so within a year.\n\n<strong>Why are sales teams adopting AI-driven technology? Because AI can provide personalized, meaningful insights that actually move the needle in sales cycles.</strong>\n<h2><strong>What information about my sales pipeline review can AI-driven technology provide that I can’t get with CRM data and spreadsheets?</strong></h2>\nGlad you asked!
