  - title: Why is this a pre-release?
    description: We have a long list of modules on our roadmap coming your way. However, we wanted to pause building more and take feedback from our users to reassure that we are headed in the right direction. Hopefully the existing modules would suffice to address a good amount of use cases to build out a single page application, if not an entire website. Since this is a beta release, not everything is perfect, so go ahead, take us for a spin, and let us know if you hit any road bumps. Share your feedback at info@pixelesq.com. 
  - title: May I submit requests for new design modules?
    description: By all means! Please include a picture, or a reference url of the design block you’d want us to build, and send it to us at info@pixelesq.com. Make sure you sign up for our newsletter so you don’t miss out on new module announcements, and latest features.
