## Introduction

The UI as a Service (UIaaS), available at <b>api.uiaas.io</b> is a read-only API for delivering UI from Pixelesq to apps, websites and other media. UI is delivered as HTML with links to styles and scripts from our CDN.

The assets are available via a globally distributed content delivery network (CDN). The server closest to the user serves all content, which minimizes latency and especially benefits mobile apps.
