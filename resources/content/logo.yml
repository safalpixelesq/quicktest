storyTitle: The story behind it
storyDesc: Look closely. Spot a cube that’s slightly open on one side? The cube
  represents a pixel and the letters P and Q in Pixelesq. The open box means
  creativity or ‘thinking out of the box’. The meadows seen through the cube
  reflect our commitment to help bring picturesque to your site.
